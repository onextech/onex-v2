In the decade ahead, technological, social and environmental forces will make strategic innovation essential for the survival of any business operating at scale. For many organizations, however, innovation can feel like fumbling in the dark, leading to new products and posts that don&rsquo;t contribute to the health and longevity of the business. In an increasingly complex world, strategy and creativity are the keys to successful, impactful innovation.</p>\n' +

From that foundation, they must identify the most valuable and viable paths for innovation based on their market position and internal capabilities. By aligning internal systems and stakeholders behind an innovation strategy crafted to achieve specific business impacts, organizations can empower growth and innovation from the inside out.</p>\n',
