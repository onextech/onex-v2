      '</blockquote>\n' +
      '<p>For hundreds of years, the maritime industry has been an important part of worldwide trade and commerce, and its significance grows with each passing day. With rising global demand for goods and raw materials, maritime transport is more important than ever, and the industry is experiencing significant changes to meet modern-day trade demands. One of the most essential aspects of this transformation is innovation, which is propelling the industry toward greater efficiency and revenue. We will look at some of the new trends and technologies that are influencing the maritime sector and making it more effective and successful in this article.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Automation</h3>\n' +
      '<p>The shift toward automation is one of the most vital in the maritime business. This has been made feasible by technological developments such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. Many of the duties typically done by people, such as navigation, cargo handling, and maintenance, are becoming automated thanks to these technologies. This not only reduces the need for human personnel and improves efficiency but also lowers the chance of human error and enhances safety. The use of remote-controlled cranes to transfer and unload goods from ships is one illustration of automation in the maritime business. Rolls-Royce, for example, has created an idea for an autonomous cargo ship fuelled by renewable energy sources such as wind and sun. The ship would be operated from a remote operations center on land, and sensors and cameras would be used to steer and avoid other boats. Another example is the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to examine ships and port infrastructure underwater. AUVs can be built with cameras and sensors to gather data and spot possible problems, such as hull damage or port infrastructure damage.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Big Data and Analytics</h3>\n' +
      "<p>The use of big data and analytics to boost decision-making is another new trend. With the growing amount of data produced by ships, ports, and transportation companies, there is an avenue to gain insights into how the industry operates and find areas for development. Companies can make more educated choices about everything from fuel usage to pricing and capacity planning by analysing data on everything from shipping routes to weather trends. Maersk, one of the world's biggest shipping firms, optimises shipping routes and reduces fuel usage by using data from its vessels. Maersk can determine the optimum route for each vessel by analysing data on variables such as wind speed and ocean currents.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Blockchain technology is also becoming more widely used in the maritime sector. Blockchain allows for the secure and open tracking of products and transactions, making it simpler to ensure regulatory adherence and reduce the risk of theft. This is particularly essential in sectors such as maritime transport, where there are numerous stakeholders engaged in the supply chain.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Renewable Energy</h3>\n' +
      "<p>The use of renewable energy sources to propel ships is another developing technology. Concerns about climate change and the environmental effect of transportation are driving a surge in demand for greener, more sustainable energy sources. As a result, innovations such as wind turbines, solar panels, and fuel cells have been developed to power ships while reducing their carbon impact. Maersk has committed to using carbon-neutral fuel in its vessels by 2030. Biofuels, hydrogen, and ammonia are among the options currently being studied by the business. Another example is the use of kite sails to boost a ship's motor power. Wind power is used to propel the ship forward, decreasing the quantity of fuel required to keep up the speed.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>3D Printing</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Finally, 3D printing technology is being used to make spare parts and ship components. Because components can be printed on demand rather than having to be acquired and transported from elsewhere, this can greatly decrease the time and expense involved in maintaining and repairing vessels. This reduces the need for ships to transport huge inventories of spare parts, increasing efficiency and lowering expenses even further. W&auml;rtsil&auml;, a shipping company, has created a 3D printing solution for making ship spare parts. Customers can use the service to submit a design for a component, which is then manufactured on demand and delivered to the user.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Final Word</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Ultimately, rising trends and technologies such as automation, big data, blockchain, autonomous shipping, green energy, and 3D printing are all playing a part in causing major changes in the maritime industry.

      "<p><em>Summary: JavaScript is a widely used programming language for modern web applications, and it's critical to make sure your code is scalable and maintainable as the application grows. Modular programming, functional programming, asynchronous programming, error handling, object-oriented programming, testing, and optimisation are advanced JavaScript approaches that can help create cleaner, simpler, and more efficient code. Modular programming entails breaking down software design into independent and interchangeable modules, whereas functional programming emphasises pure functions and immutable data structures. Asynchronous programming is useful for tasks that require I/O, and error handling is essential when developing robust systems. Classes and objects are used to represent entities in object-oriented programming, and testing and optimisation are critical for ensuring code quality and performance. Developers can write simple code by employing such methods for ease of understanding, testing, and modifying over time.</em></p>\n" +
      "<p>For creating modern web applications, JavaScript is one of the most frequently used programming languages. Even when your application grows in size and complexity, I t is vital to make sure that your code is still maintainable and scalable. We'll look at some advanced JavaScript approaches in this article in order for you to create cleaner, simpler code that's also easier to maintain.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Modular Programming</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Software design technique can be&nbsp;divided into independent and interchangeable&nbsp;modules using the approach of modular programming. As such,&nbsp;you can create complicated systems by dissembling them into simpler, easier-to-manage parts. In JavaScript, modules can be used to group together related functionality and lessen the coupling between various sections of your code.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Functional Programming</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Pure functions and immutable data are prioritized while using the functional programming paradigm. Pure functions have no side effects and consistently return the same result for a given input. You can write code that is simpler to understand, test, and maintain by using pure functions. Moreover, immutable data structures, which help to prevent unforeseen modifications to your data, are encouraged by functional programming.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Asynchronous Programming</h3>\n' +
      '<p>With the help of the asynchronous programming model, you can run code without impeding the main thread of operation. This technique is extremely useful for tasks that require I/O, such as&nbsp;sending HTTP requests or working with a database. To develop asynchronous code in JavaScript, you can use callbacks, promises, or the async/await syntax.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Error Handling</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Building robust systems requires careful error handling. Consider utilising&nbsp;try/catch blocks&nbsp;in JavaScript for handling runtime issues or tools like linters and static analysis tools to pick out&nbsp;mistakes before your code is even run.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>\n' +
      '<p>A programming paradigm known as object-oriented programming employs objects to represent entities in the actual world. Classes and objects can be used in JavaScript to group together relevant data and behaviour. Inheritance can also be used to reuse code and encourage code reuse.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Testing</h3>\n' +
      '<p>The process of creating high-quality software must include testing. You can create and execute tests for your JavaScript code using frameworks like Jest or Mocha. Writing tests ensure that&nbsp;that your code is operating according to plan&nbsp;and avoid regressions.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Optimization</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Optimization is the process of making your code run faster and more efficiently. Performance can be increased in JavaScript by employing strategies like lazy loading, memoization, and caching. In addition, you can find performance bottlenecks in your code by using techniques like profiling and tracing.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Final Word</h3>\n' +
      "<p>In conclusion, by utilising these advanced JavaScript approaches, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient code. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale system, these techniques will assist you in writing code that are simple to comprehend, test, and modify over time. Always keep in mind that producing a great code involves more than simply finding solutions to issues, it also involves making sure that your code is simple for ease of comprehension and maintenance.</p>",

    html:
      "<p>Want to unlock the full potential of your business through new technology? We've got you covered.</p>\n" +
      '<p>In today&rsquo;s competitive business world, staying ahead of the game means having access to the latest technologies and being able to successfully implement them. Implementing new technology can be a daunting task and success requires meticulous preparation and execution. So, we&rsquo;ve done the hard lifting for you. This guide will provide you with all the information you need to successfully implement new technologies within your organisation and level up your business.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Conduct a Needs Assessment</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Before&nbsp;implementing new technologies, it is essential that you identify the particular requirements and pain points that your company is facing. This can help you decide which technologies will provide the greatest value and ensuring that your investment is targeted on tackling the most pressing business challenges.</p>\n' +
      '<p>If your company has chosen to adopt a new technology, there is most likely a compelling factor, or a combination of factors, that led to that decision.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Establish your implementation rationale; <em>why</em> is your company implementing this new software?</p>\n' +
      '<p><em>Is your company implementing this technology to:</em></p>\n' +
      '<ul>\n' +
      '<li><em>Lower your expenses?</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Monitor general progress?</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Boost output and efficiency?</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Substitute obsolete processes and technology?</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Make it easier for team members to communicate?</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Start a company transformation which your present technology is insufficient to support?</em></li>\n' +
      '</ul>\n' +
      '<p>Establishing which aspects of new technology will provide the quickest and most effective solutions will provide accurate insights on what should be your top priorities. Otherwise, introducing technology into a workforce too quickly or with too many moving components at once may leave your team overwhelmed with too much knowledge.</p>\n' +
      "<p>Discuss your team's pain points and promote an open discussion with workers, leaders, and managers in each area. It is important to note that the difficulties that one department encounters may be completely different from the difficulties that another department have. As a result, we need to include everyone in these discussions in order to have a full picture.</p>\n" +
      '<p>When you observe what is not working, you can find where the gaps or inconsistencies are in the process. These gaps assist you in determining the areas that need to be filled first and the particular technologies that are most effective.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Establish Clear Goals and Objectives</h2>\n' +
      '<p>When implementing new technologies, it is crucial to establish defined aims and targets, such as increasing output, lowering expenses, or improving customer experiences. Having clear goals in sight can help guarantee that technology is implemented in a manner that supports the overall growth of the company.</p>\n' +
      '<ul>\n' +
      '<li><em>Clearly describe what success would look like in terms of results.</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Establish short- and long-term aims and aspirations, as well as general completion deadlines for each stage.</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>A clear strategy will simplify the process to track performance and ensure that everyone is on the same page about what needs to be done.</em></li>\n' +
      '</ul>\n' +
      '<h2>Create a Cross-Functional Team</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Implementing new technologies demands a joint effort from various divisions and individuals within the company. This group should include anyone who will be immediately affected by the implementation, such as IT experts and customer support representatives, as well as chief executives or other decision makers. Creating a cross-functional team can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that technology is used to support the overall company goals.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Develop a Comprehensive Implementation Plan</h2>\n' +
      "<p>After you've assembled your cross-functional team, you'll need to create a thorough implementation plan that outlines all of the steps needed to set up the technology. This should include everything from choosing the appropriate technology and training workers to tracking progress and measuring effectiveness.</p>\n" +
      '<p><em>Your Implementation Plan should Include:</em></p>\n' +
      '<ul>\n' +
      '<li><em>Timelines</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Budgets</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Milestones</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Contingencies for any problems that may emerge during the implementation phase</em></li>\n' +
      '</ul>\n' +
      '<h2>Train Employees</h2>\n' +
      '<p>New technologies means the inevitable development of new capabilities and workflows. Without adequate training, your team will be unable to discover the maximum potential of the new software and will not be able to implement it effectively to improve current systems.</p>\n' +
      '<p>A mentoring system combined with an implementation training program can assist employees in grasping the newly introduced processes and operations that come with the new technology. Designated mentors can receive intensive training with the new technology or software first so that they will have an authentic, first-hand understanding of how to successfully communicate that information to other workers. Then, the comprehensive training strategy can enable these selected leaders and managers to share their expertise with workers.</p>\n' +
      '<p>New training implementation technology is perfect for developing an effective and efficient training process.</p>\n' +
      '<ul>\n' +
      '<li><em>Rather than using paper manuals or monotonous lectures to teach employees, use a training program or software to keep them involved and alert.</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>Choose interactive training programs that encourage workers to participate in their training sessions.</em></li>\n' +
      '</ul>\n' +
      '<p>While learning the features of a new technology, employees may have queries or face difficulties. Software training programs are ideal for providing workers with answers and real-time assistance throughout the process.</p>\n' +
      '<p><em>Your training plan should include:</em></p>\n' +
      '<ul>\n' +
      '<li><em>In-depth instruction on how to use the system</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>How employees can troubleshoot any issues</em></li>\n' +
      '<li><em>How everyone can ensure they are up-to-date with changes or updates made to the system</em></li>\n' +
      '</ul>\n' +
      '<h2>Monitor and Evaluate Progress</h2>\n' +
      '<p>It is imperative to frequently monitor and evaluate progress to ensure that the new technology is producing the anticipated outcomes. Set up frequent milestones as part of your general execution plan to evaluate progress and assess how well the system is functioning. This could include gathering input from team members and customers, as well as using analytics tools to monitor key performance metrics. This will assist you in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring that your new technology is applied as efficiently as possible.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Continuously Adapt and Improve</h2>\n' +
      "<p>Last but not least, consider implementing new technology as a continuous process, not a one-time affair. Even after the original implementation, you should continue to assess the system's functionality and find areas for improvement. This can include analysing and revising the implementation plan on a frequent basis, as well as constantly looking for new ways to utilise the new technology to grow your company.</p>\n" +
      "<p>To stay up with the latest trends and advancements, it is critical to adjust and enhance your execution strategy. You can ensure that your organisation stays relevant in today's rapid evolving marketplace by remaining on top of industry changes and adjusting effectively.</p>\n" +
      '<p>Choosing the right technology to meet organisational objectives does not have to be a guessing game.</p>\n' +
      '<p>You can ensure that the adoption of novel technologies works in your advantage by conducting thorough evaluation, establishing clear goals, and diligent execution planning.</p>',

    html:
      '<p><em>The COVID-19 epidemic has changed the way we work, driving companies to seek remote work approaches in order to keep operations functioning during lockdowns and constraints. Companies are currently examining how to implement a hybrid work paradigm that balances flexibility and productivity in the following the pandemic&nbsp;with&nbsp;the progressive lifting of restrictions.</em></p>\n' +
      '<h2>Hybrid Workforces</h2>\n' +
      '<p>A hybrid workforce combines the benefits of in-person and remote work to create a flexible working environment that accommodates employee preferences and business needs. In this model, employees can work from home or the office, depending on their roles, responsibilities, and personal circumstances. For example, employees who require more collaboration or have roles that are better suited to in-person work may come to the office, while others who prefer working from home or have roles that require minimal interaction with others can work remotely.</p>\n' +
      '<p>By merging the advantages of in-person and remote work to offer a fluid working environment that caters to employee preferences as well as corporate needs, employees can work from home or the office in this approach, depending on their roles, tasks, and personal situations. Employees who demand more communication or have responsibilities that are better suited to work in person, for example, may come to the office, but others who enjoy working from home or have roles that require fewer interactions with others may work remotely.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Addressing the Psychological Challenges of Hybrid Working</h3>\n' +
      '<p>However, in order to reap the benefits of a team that is working&nbsp;hybrid, businesses have to address the issues that it brings. Managing efficiency and teamwork in a remote work environment is one of its most difficult issues. While remote work can boost productivity by eliminating distractions and allowing people to work at their own pace, it can also lead to working in&nbsp;solitude, decreased social engagement, and fatigue. Furthermore, remote workers may face technical problems such as poor internet connectivity, insufficient equipment, and security issues.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Companies must establish clear communication and collaboration protocols that encourage trust, transparency, and accountability among team members as a means to overcome such issues. Establishing expectations for work hours, communication channels, and response times, as well as offering training and support for remote work tools and technology should be done. Furthermore, businesses ought to promote a culture of inclusion and belonging that acknowledges and encourages the specific requirements of both remote and in-person workers.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Combatting Potential Workplace Inequality</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Another problem of a hybrid workforce is ensuring that all employees have equal opportunity and are treated fairly. Face-to-face interactions, informal conversations, and potential possibilities&nbsp;for job development and progress may be forfeited for remote workers. They may also feel&nbsp;excluded from decision-making, team-building, and business culture events.</p>\n' +
      '<p>To address such concerns, organisations should give equitable access to training, mentoring, and networking opportunities for remote workers, as well as engage them in team meetings and decision-making processes. Furthermore, businesses should ensure that their regulations and procedures are inclusive and equal, taking into account the demands of all employees, regardless of their working conditions or personal situations. This includes&nbsp;addressing mental health and well-being concerns.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Overall, the hybrid workforce continues to be a promising option for businesses seeking to balance flexibility and productivity in the post-pandemic period. Companies may establish a flexible working environment that supports the different requirements and preferences of their employees while also fostering productivity, collaboration, and inclusivity by combining the benefits of in-person and remote work. However, in order to fully&nbsp;take advantage of these benefits, businesses must also address the associated challenges, such as maintaining productivity and collaboration in a remote work environment, ensuring equal opportunities and fair treatment for all employees, and developing a culture of inclusivity and belonging that supports both remote and in-person workers.</p>\n' +
      '<p>As businesses continue to navigate&nbsp;the post-pandemic age, it is apparent that the hybrid workforce will be crucial in creating the future of employment. By implementing this paradigm, businesses may adapt to changing workforce needs, remain competitive in the global economy, and build a more robust and sustainable business model.</p>',

By employing IPA successfully, companies can better allocate their people and resources for more meaningful tasks and drive efficiency across the organisation suggesting that focus can be shifted heavily on growing their operations - providing better service to customers. Additionally, IPA provides businesses with access to analytics that enable them to gain insight into how their processes are performing, identify any bottlenecks or potential areas of improvement, and design more efficient workflows. While IPA takes over rote tasks, employers can focus on delighting customers and considering how new troves of data outside the organisation&mdash;from news, events, social media, embedded sensors, and elsewhere&mdash;will aid in achieving business objectives.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Scalability</h3>\n' +
      "<p>Scalability can be easily addressed with the use of IPA. Combining the power of artificial intelligence and robotic process to automate routine, rule-based operations enables companies to scale their operations quickly and efficiently while reducing costs associated with manual labor. IPA's sophisticated algorithms is capable of identifying patterns in data, self-correcting errors, improving accuracy and efficiency, and detecting any potential problems before they become costly. Additionally, IPA reduces the workload on employees and frees up time for more complex or creative work. Now, organisations are able to scale their operations faster than ever before.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Adaptability</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Furthermore, IPA can help companies stay ahead of their competitors by providing them with ways to quickly adjust to evolving customer demands and market dynamics. Businesses can swiftly respond to customer needs and seize any new market opportunities that present themselves by utilising automated processes. Consequently, organisations are more capable of delivering more individualised services and experiences while boosting general customer satisfaction.</p>\n' +
      '<p>By leveraging the power of implementing IPA, businesses can meet customer demands while saving time, resources, and money. Investing in Intelligent Process Automation is the key for streamlining operations and optimising work processes which leads to increased efficiency and better customer experiences.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Although the full range of benefits comes from implementing the complete IPA suite, companies can unlock significant value quickly through individual elements. Whether you are a large enterprise or a small business, the benefits of intelligent automation alone cannot be ignored. Automation can help organisations make informed decisions. With automated solutions, companies can make informed decisions and respond to customer demands, allowing them to stay ahead of the competition. So don&rsquo;t delay, start taking advantage of IPA today and begin unlocking your business growth!</p>',

      "<p>The colour palette of the company is a vital component of its visual identity. Colours have the ability to elicit emotions, form associations, and affect purchasing decisions. As a result, it's critical to use colours that fit the brand's personality and ideals. Blue, for example, is frequently connected with trust and dependability, whereas green is associated with growth and sustainability.</p>\n" +
      '<h2>Typography</h2>\n' +
      "<p>The fonts utilised should be in tune with the brand's personality and legible across all platforms. The style of font used by the business should be consistent throughout every point of contact, such as website design, social media posts, and marketing materials.</p>\n" +
      '<h2>Imagery</h2>\n' +
      '<p>The brand should choose visuals that are consistent with its values and messaging. Photographs, illustrations, and graphics are examples of such&nbsp;visuals. The imagery used by the brand should be consistent across all touchpoints, resulting in a unified and identifiable visual identity.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Brand Message</h2>\n' +
      "<p>The brand's messaging is a key component of its spoken identity. At&nbsp;various points of contact ranging from&nbsp;website writing, social media posts to&nbsp;marketing materials, should have a unified message. The messaging should be consistent with the brand's values, personality, and mission creating a cohesive and authentic brand voice.</p>\n" +
      '<h2>Brand Tone</h2>\n' +
      '<p>The tone of the brand is also an important aspect of its verbal identity. The tone&nbsp;should be in line with its personality and values, prompting an emotional response from its target audience. A brand with a playful personality, for example, would employ a lighthearted and humorous tone, whereas a brand with a more serious attitude might use a formal and authoritative tone.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Brand Identity</h2>\n' +
      "<p>Brand identity&nbsp;features its values, mission, and purpose. The principles and beliefs that influence a brand's activities and decisions are represented by its values. A brand's mission statement explains why it exists and what it stands for. These components are critical in developing a strong and authentic brand identity that resonates with its target audience.</p>\n" +
      '<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n' +
      '<p>In conclusion, creating a holistic brand identity entails more than just a logo or a great phrase. A brand identity is made up of many visual and linguistic aspects that work together to form a unified and memorable portrayal of the brand. A powerful and authentic brand identity reflects the personality, values, and mission of the brand, distinguishing it from competitors and resonating with its target audience. A brand may design a comprehensive brand identity that develops an emotional connection with its customers and promotes financial success by analysing its target demographic, competition, and unique value offer.</p>',

      "<p>In today's fast-paced business world, attracting and retaining top talent is more important than ever. However, simply hiring the best people is not enough to ensure success. Building effective teams requires a thoughtful approach to talent management, including a focus on organisational design.</p>\n" +
      "<p>Organisational design refers to the process of structuring and aligning an organisation's systems, processes, and people to achieve its goals. In the realm of talent management, organisational design is crucial in establishing the ideal atmosphere for employees to thrive and contribute to the organisation's success.</p>\n" +
      '<p>Here are some key ways that organisational design can help build better teams:</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities</h3>\n' +
      "<p>One of the primary functions of organisational design is to clarify roles and responsibilities. Organisation can minimise confusion and increase accountability by clearly outlining each team member's role and responsibilities. This, in turn, can help in the development of trust and improve communication among team members.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Creating Efficient Workflows</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Organisational design can also aid in process optimisation by detecting bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Teams can work more efficiently and effectively by streamlining processes and eliminating unnecessary phases. Employees are less likely to be frustrated by bureaucratic processes, which can contribute to higher job satisfaction.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Encouraging Collaboration</h3>\n' +
      "<p>By breaking down silos and creating cross-functional teams, effective organisational design may also promote cooperation. Organisations can benefit from their employees' cumulative knowledge and experience by establishing a collaborative culture, that contributes to better decision-making and problem-solving.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Facilitating Learning and Development</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Organisational design is another way to facilitate learning and development. Organisations can assist employees acquire new skills and stay relevant with the latest trends and technologies by providing opportunities for training and professional development. As a result, work satisfaction and retention may improve.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Promoting Diversity and Inclusion</h3>\n' +
      '<p>By fostering a culture that celebrates and respects differences, organisational design can also serve to promote diversity and inclusion. This can include initiatives such as&nbsp;promoting inclusive communication and decision-making processes, as well as hiring policies that prioritise diversity.</p>\n' +
      '<p>In order to reap the benefits of organisational design, organisations must take a deliberate and strategic approach to talent management. This includes:</p>\n' +
      "<h3>Defining the organisation's Goals and Objectives</h3>\n" +
      "<p>The aims and objectives of the organisation must be aligned&nbsp;with the organisational design. This entails taking the effort to clearly define the organisation's goals and identifying the skills and competencies required to attain them.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Identifying Key Roles and Skills</h3>\n' +
      "<p>Determining the critical responsibilities and talents required to meet the organisation's goals and objectives involves performing a detailed examination of the organisation's current staff in order to identify any skill shortfalls or areas where additional expertise is required.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Developing Talent Management Strategies</h3>\n' +
      "<p>The next crucial step is to develop talent management strategies after having an in-depth understanding of the company's objectives and the talents essential to accomplish them. This involves recruitment, training and development, performance management, and career progression initiatives.</p>\n" +
      '<h3>Implementing and Evaluating Organisational Design</h3>\n' +
      '<p>At last, companies needs to put their organisational design concepts into action and monitor their efficacy over time. Regular performance assessments, staff surveys, and other techniques of obtaining feedback and data to identify areas for development may be used.</p>\n' +
      "<p>In conclusion, developing better teams requires a strategic approach to talent management that focuses on organisational design. Organisations may establish a setting where employees can thrive and contribute to the organisation's success by clarifying roles and responsibilities, developing efficient processes, fostering cooperation, facilitating learning and development, and promoting diversity and inclusion.</p>",

    html:
      "<p>Over the last few years, digital transformation has become one of the most widely-recognised topics in business with companies racing to acquire digital capabilities to drive their business forward. Referring to the adoption of digital technology used to improve fundamental business practices, digital transformation has been a necessary disruption that continues to affect every industry. With an increasing number of <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2018/04/15/going-digital-in-banking-dbs-citi-bbva-ing-lead-the-way/?sh=3088b09a5877'>companies stepping forward to report record-breaking figures from new digital agendas</a>, going digital has proven to be an essential success factor for businesses today.</p>\n" +
      '<p>However, despite the growing literature and support available on this issue, digitalisation at scale is far from trivial. For every success story published, comes many other case studies of failed attempts at digital transformation. A few of such cases are noted in <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/why-so-many-high-profile-digital-transformations-fail">this 2018 Harvard Business Review article</a> which cites the high-profile failures of companies such as GE, Nike, and P&G in their digital transformation journey. With many other such powerful organisations struggling to make sense of this undertaking despite their abundant resources, attaining successful digital transformation seems more elusive than ever.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Fortunately, by examining the actions of today’s digital leaders, we are able to gain new insights on the secrets behind successful digital transformation strategies. After all, there are a few indicators that many successfully transformed companies have in common which may serve as worthwhile lessons to companies still finding success.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Leadership</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Digital transformation starts from the top and commitment by the company’s key management is vital to the success of any digital transformation strategy. Organisations must understand that digital transformation is a long term commitment and not simply a technology upgrade. Shareholders need to be aware of the costs of digital transformation and be committed to stick with the change for the long-haul even if it means making capital losses in the beginning. Management buy-in is crucial in ensuring that budget and other resources are rightfully allocated to support change initiatives that drive transformation. Management also needs to be open to suggestions from the ground up while avoiding being change-resistant so as to foster open innovation and transformation success.</p>\n' +
      '<p>At its heart, digital transformation is more about cultural and organisational change than technology change. It requires a change in company culture and cultural changes cannot happen without leadership. Managers responsible for digital transformation need to actively steer the organisation towards a corporate culture that embraces digital paradigms. Reinventing an organisation’s culture at the enterprise level is an enormous undertaking and requires a concerted effort from its leaders. To effectively influence corporate culture, management must work in unison to communicate the vision of a digitally transformed workplace.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Successful digital transformation ultimately requires a transformational approach. Leaders who are dedicated, open to change, and are able to inspire cultural reinvention across the organisation will be more likely to find success in their digital transformation strategy.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Collaboration</h3>\n' +
      '<p>While leadership serves as the fuse that sparks digital transformation, collaboration is the catalyst that ignites its success. Digital transformation requires an end-to-end change across the entire organisation and empowering workers to contribute is crucial in ensuring the success of a lasting digital transformation strategy.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Organisational change can create a sense of confusion for employees who are kept in the dark of new initiatives. Every member of the organisation needs to be involved in achieving a shared vision of a successful digital transformation. Managers can do so by promoting greater transparency and engaging employees in key matters of change. On the ground, operational changes need to be clearly communicated to workers to avoid misaligned priorities and bottlenecks. Managers need to align team members with change efforts and build trust by working together on issues that may arise from change.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Digital transformation is about changing the way teams work together and not just about the tools at use. Employees should be empowered to make decisions and given opportunities to contribute ideas. Empowering people is the key to achieving profound and inclusive digital transformation that drives sustainable growth.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Process</h3>\n' +
      '<p>For success to take place, digital transformation must be viewed as a continuum. Organisations must acknowledge that digital transformation is not a one-off project but rather a continuous improvement across people, processes, and technology. By embracing digital transformation as a journey rather than a destination, managers can shift focus from merely pursuing technical upgrades to ensuring holistic change throughout the organisation.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Digital transformation is a process to establish change as a competency in itself. A successful digital transformation is consequently dependent on how integrated change is woven into an organisation’s core capabilities. With technology constantly evolving, companies that view digital transformation as an ongoing process are better positioned to adapt and succeed.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Final word</h3>\n' +
      '<p>When you look beyond the buzz surrounding the topic of digital transformation and its related technical concepts, you may notice that digital transformation is more about how organisations deal with change rather than the tools they use. Companies that succeed at digital transformation are ultimately the ones that are able to deal with change better. In finding success, managers approaching the issue of digital transformation should continue to explore and adopt technologies while bearing change management principles at heart. Enterprises that succeed in adapting to today’s digital landscape will be ones who stand to gain the most in the exciting times ahead.</p>\n',

      '<p>Amidst a growing trend advocating business digitisation in recent years, everyone is talking about going digital. Companies already riding atop the digital wave are continuing to build out winning capabilities at an accelerating pace every day. However for the uninitiated, approaching the already established dialogue on digital could prove to be too late or overwhelming to be worthwhile. Yet as the growing digital trend shows no signs of stopping in today&rsquo;s computer age, businesses from all walks of life are gradually returning to the drawing board with new digital agendas. With many more companies today diving head first into digital territories with announcements of new initiatives to go digital, one cannot help but wonder &mdash; what does going digital really mean?</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Not just a buzzword</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Organisations approaching the topic of going digital should look beyond the buzz to get a deeper understanding of what digital really means in order to apply it effectively. Within the technology industry, there is a tendency to equivocate frequently discussed topics as buzzwords that come and go with time. In recent years, the industry has been buzzing about the idea of digitisation as headlines concerning the topic began making rounds at conferences. Phrases such as digital transformation and technological reinvention are a few examples of terminology that underpins its seemingly superfluous existence. But the notion of going digital has proven to be more than a passing fad. With its ever-growing appeal in boardroom agendas, the imperative to become digital has transcended the industry to achieve mainstream status.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>No smoke without fire</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Beyond the hype surrounding its popularity, the motivation behind going digital is well-grounded. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1624046/Digital%20Business%20Executive%20Summary_FINAL.pdf?t=1534365095051">report by the International Data Group (IDG) in 2018</a>&nbsp;found that 89% of organisations surveyed have adopted or already have plans to adopt digital strategies. The high level of digital adoption rates highlights the rising significance of digital technology and its implications for businesses today. Driven by the need for change in an ever so competitive business world, going digital bears major implications for businesses of all kinds.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>Open to interpretation</h3>\n' +
      '<p>Despite its widespread influence, the meaning behind digital still remains an ambiguous concept for many. In its definitive form, the term digital simply describes electronic technology that records binary information. However in reality, the meaning of digital manifests across a multitude of interpretations in various fields.</p>\n' +
      '<p>For many people in the technology and business sectors, the word digital still conjures up an abstract mixture of thoughts. In the technology market, digital services are often misunderstood as being limited to the marketing practice in the form of digital marketing. While in the business world, digital continues to be packaged to mean different things for different people. For some executives, it&rsquo;s about the complex technical systems that are used at work. While for others, digital could simply be about enhancing the customer experience.</p>\n' +
      '<p>None of the above interpretations are necessarily wrong. But as a result of its abstract origins and varied interpretations, it is important to note that going digital can sometimes mean entirely different things for different organisations.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Having a shared goal</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Without a common understanding of what digital means, companies implementing digital strategies may find their efforts misdirected as initiatives and employees lack alignment. It is difficult to paint a shared vision of a digital workplace across the organisation when people have different interpretations of what digital means. Being able to define what digital is and what it is not will help companies approach and apply change in the right direction. For managers leading digital initiatives, learning how to articulate what being digital means is the first step in communicating a shared vision of a digitised organisation.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>All in the mind</h2>\n' +
      '<p>While going digital invokes a myriad of definitions, it is fundamentally a shift in mindset in the way business is carried out in an organisation. This mindset shift describes the change process in which a company&rsquo;s approach to work, culture, and its offerings are reinvented with the help of technology in order to create new or greater value for customers and itself.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Promoting a digital mindset means embracing cultural change within the organisation. When businesses embark on plans to go digital, the initial questions that are asked are seldom about technical feasibilities nor technological needs. More often than not, the key concerns revolve around implementing and managing cultural changes that cultivate a digital mindset amongst people and processes.</p>\n' +
      '<p>The creation of a value-driven culture challenges employees to redefine the way work is done across all levels of the organisation. In redefining value, managers need to focus on shaping culture rather than chasing rigid outcomes. By focusing on the process of creating a digitally-enabled culture rather than brooding over the kind of systems being implemented, executives can better foster the birth of foundational digital capabilities that drive long-term value. This cyclical process of cultural change and value creation inherently represents the meaning of going digital.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Final word</h2>\n' +
      '<p>To achieve success, it is important to be able to define digital and the way it is going to be applied throughout the organisation. Leaders needs to have a clear definition of what digital means in order to communicate digital strategies across the organisation. Owning a better understanding of what digital truly means can help executives gain a complete insight on how to apply it effectively.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Recognising that going digital refers to a process rather than an outcome is a crucial step in defining what it means. Businesses should view digital as a way of doing things rather than a thing in itself. At its core, going digital is more than just moving offline services online. What really matters is the process of change that it promotes within the organisation. Companies that go digital are essentially undergoing a process of redefining value for its stakeholders.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Going digital itself is a means to an end, where the end goal is to derive the most value from the process of change. Companies that acknowledge digital as a process are better equipped to make decisions that will lead to success, whereas companies that perceive digital as an outcome are set up to fail. The hardest part of going digital comes from dealing with the mindset shift from old habits of doing work. Going digital is not easy, but with the right definition and mindset, all the investment will pay off.</p>\n',

      '<p>In the production of goods and services, businesses are often presented with multiple levels of inefficiencies in the form of menial and repetitive work. Labour-intensive jobs are increasingly costing companies more to manage due to the rising cost of labour in a rapidly globalised world. Increasing headcount as a way to complete human-operated tasks on time has traditionally been the only way out for managers. However, modern technologies today has provided companies with new and innovative ways to deal with this age-old operational challenge. In recent years, business process automation has emerged as the solution to continuing operational challenges. Enabled by advances in the fields of software robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, the benefits of automation have risen exponentially over the years. The new-found potential of business process automation today has led organisations to rethink their operations management strategies and the future of their workforce.</p>\n' +
      '<h2><Efficiency</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Operational management and execution form the bulk of activities conducted by businesses every day. As an integral part of any organisation, operations management determines the amount of value a company can produce in any given period. Companies with higher operational efficiency are able to create more value and therefore generate higher levels of profit in the long run.</p>\n' +
      '<p>A key dynamic of operational efficiency is the way in which work is done in an organisation. In most organisations, teams rely on workflows to get work done by distributing labour across procedures and pre-defined business rules. In the pursuit of operational efficiency, companies are turning to the optimisation of these workflows via automation.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Automation defines the way work is performed with minimal or zero human intervention. The term business process automation is derived from the application of automation principles in a business context. Business process automation enables a company to streamline its operational processes with simplified workflows, and reduces its reliance on manpower in achieving business outcomes.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Success</h2>\n' +
      '<p>As modern societies evolve towards service and experiential-based economies, demand for future business has shifted towards knowledge-based services instead of manufacturing output. In a bid to prioritise limited resources on higher value businesses over labour-intensive work, companies today are actively looking for ways to adopt and increase automation in their businesses.</p>\n' +
      '<p>With the rising prominence of business process automation in recent years, organisations are making automation a strategic priority in their core operations. According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/the-automation-imperative">McKinsey report in 2018</a>, 75% of surveyed companies have already begun or are planning to automate business processes in the immediate year, suggesting that business process automation is becoming a key priority during strategic planning processes in modern boardrooms.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Today, business process automation has become a highly prioritised enabler of business success for many organisations. A company&#39;s ability to perform complex and labour-intensive tasks in a reliable and productive fashion is a key driver of business success. Studies have shown that organisations that embrace business process automation are more likely to stay ahead of competition and succeed in their market. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Predictions+2018+Automation+Alters+The+Global+Workforce/-/E-RES139991">report published by Forrester Research in 2018</a>&nbsp;predicts that process automation is a key indicator of success in future generations of businesses, with companies that excel in automation not only succeeding, but also becoming dominant forces in their industries.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Tools</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Automation technologies exists for companies dealing with various types of operational challenges with each type of automation technology built for problems of varying business complexity.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Stemming from the long-standing popularity of the Microsoft Excel software in business communities, Excel macros are amongst the first choices for companies considering automation. Widely recognised as the de facto automation solution amongst Excel users, Excel&#39;s macro feature offers managers a graphical user interface for automating routine calculations. With Excel macros, managers can easily record procedures to create automation routines which can be stored, shared, and run by others at a later time. Advanced users in Excel also have access to the programming language that runs the software itself. The programming language, better known as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), allows users to customise macros in order to create more powerful automation routines in their workflows.</p>\n' +
      '<p>While Excel macros allow companies to gain automation capability with relative ease, they are only effective for manipulating data within the Excel program itself. Operational challenges that exist in other parts of the organisation&#39;s workflow require more advanced forms of automation outside of the software.</p>\n' +
      '<p>In automating operations across a general spectrum of tasks, a form of automation technology called Robotic Process Automation (RPA) takes the lead. As an emerging domain in business process automation, robotic process automation subscribes to the notion of employing software robots to perform high-volume repeatable tasks from within a workstation. Robotic process automation technology enables managers to configure a program to interact with existing applications on a computer by triggering events to manipulate data in order to fulfill the desired task.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Robotic process automation solutions are adaptable and flexible enough to handle a wide range of tasks. Most reputable robotic process automation software today are able to take control of a computer&#39;s screen, navigate across web pages, fill in forms, generate documents, send emails, and even communicate with other workstations. With robotic process automation, managers can simply instruct the software robot to follow a pre-defined sequence of steps when encountering repetitive work and watch the task run to completion from the comforts of their desk.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Eliminating the need for low value, repetitive work across the organisation, robotic process automation has opened up an era of possibilities for companies exploring more efficient operational strategies.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Yet, even as robotic process automation marches into the future, it is limited by the scope of its mechanical workflows. With the need for sequences to be programmed in advanced, all plausible scenarios must be foreseen ahead of time in order to prevent unexpected errors from breaking the automation workflow. Unlike human operators, robotic software lack the ability to derive decisions based on business logic, and must be manually commanded to complete tasks.</p>\n' +
      '<p>However in recent years, developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence have given rise to more powerful cognitive abilities. With mounting competitive pressure in the robotic process automation software market today, automation providers are gearing towards cognitive-based automation capabilities to expand their offerings.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Final Words</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Heralding a new wave of automation solutions, modern robotic process automation tools enhanced with cognitive capabilities allow automation software robots to mimic human actions to a larger degree. These cognitive-enabled robots are able to process information with in-depth analysis, learn from heuristics, and make business decisions at levels of accuracy. Organisations that are able to harness these capabilities will gain the ability to automate complex tasks with greater ease and efficiency. As the latest addition to automation technology, machine learning and artificial intelligence promises to take business process automation to the next level.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Through its humble beginnings and well-grounded motivations, business process automation will continue to be an essential enabler of business success in the days to come. The application of automation tools such as macros and robotic software will continue to proliferate alongside rising business demand as the influence of machine learning and artificial intelligence takes flight.</p>\n',

      '<p>With the rising prominence of business process automation in recent years, organisations are making automation a strategic priority in their core operations. According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/the-automation-imperative">McKinsey report in 2018</a>, 75% of surveyed companies have already begun or are planning to automate business processes in the immediate year, suggesting that business process automation is becoming a key priority during strategic planning processes in modern boardrooms.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Today, business process automation has become a highly prioritised enabler of business success for many organisations. A company&#39;s ability to perform complex and labour-intensive tasks in a reliable and productive fashion is a key driver of business success. Studies have shown that organisations that embrace business process automation are more likely to stay ahead of competition and succeed in their market. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Predictions+2018+Automation+Alters+The+Global+Workforce/-/E-RES139991">report published by Forrester Research in 2018</a>&nbsp;predicts that process automation is a key indicator of success in future generations of businesses, with companies that excel in automation not only succeeding, but also becoming dominant forces in their industries.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Tools</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Automation technologies exists for companies dealing with various types of operational challenges with each type of automation technology built for problems of varying business complexity.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Stemming from the long-standing popularity of the Microsoft Excel software in business communities, Excel macros are amongst the first choices for companies considering automation. Widely recognised as the de facto automation solution amongst Excel users, Excel&#39;s macro feature offers managers a graphical user interface for automating routine calculations. With Excel macros, managers can easily record procedures to create automation routines which can be stored, shared, and run by others at a later time. Advanced users in Excel also have access to the programming language that runs the software itself. The programming language, better known as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), allows users to customise macros in order to create more powerful automation routines in their workflows.</p>\n' +
      '<p>While Excel macros allow companies to gain automation capability with relative ease, they are only effective for manipulating data within the Excel program itself. Operational challenges that exist in other parts of the organisation&#39;s workflow require more advanced forms of automation outside of the software.</p>\n' +
      '<p>In automating operations across a general spectrum of tasks, a form of automation technology called Robotic Process Automation (RPA) takes the lead. As an emerging domain in business process automation, robotic process automation subscribes to the notion of employing software robots to perform high-volume repeatable tasks from within a workstation. Robotic process automation technology enables managers to configure a program to interact with existing applications on a computer by triggering events to manipulate data in order to fulfill the desired task.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Robotic process automation solutions are adaptable and flexible enough to handle a wide range of tasks. Most reputable robotic process automation software today are able to take control of a computer&#39;s screen, navigate across web pages, fill in forms, generate documents, send emails, and even communicate with other workstations. With robotic process automation, managers can simply instruct the software robot to follow a pre-defined sequence of steps when encountering repetitive work and watch the task run to completion from the comforts of their desk.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Eliminating the need for low value, repetitive work across the organisation, robotic process automation has opened up an era of possibilities for companies exploring more efficient operational strategies.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Yet, even as robotic process automation marches into the future, it is limited by the scope of its mechanical workflows. With the need for sequences to be programmed in advanced, all plausible scenarios must be foreseen ahead of time in order to prevent unexpected errors from breaking the automation workflow. Unlike human operators, robotic software lack the ability to derive decisions based on business logic, and must be manually commanded to complete tasks.</p>\n' +
      '<p>However in recent years, developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence have given rise to more powerful cognitive abilities. With mounting competitive pressure in the robotic process automation software market today, automation providers are gearing towards cognitive-based automation capabilities to expand their offerings.</p>\n' +
      '<h2>Final Words</h2>\n' +
      '<p>Heralding a new wave of automation solutions, modern robotic process automation tools enhanced with cognitive capabilities allow automation software robots to mimic human actions to a larger degree. These cognitive-enabled robots are able to process information with in-depth analysis, learn from heuristics, and make business decisions at levels of accuracy. Organisations that are able to harness these capabilities will gain the ability to automate complex tasks with greater ease and efficiency. As the latest addition to automation technology, machine learning and artificial intelligence promises to take business process automation to the next level.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Through its humble beginnings and well-grounded motivations, business process automation will continue to be an essential enabler of business success in the days to come. The application of automation tools such as macros and robotic software will continue to proliferate alongside rising business demand as the influence of machine learning and artificial intelligence takes flight.</p>\n',

    html:
      "<p>Colour has the greatest ability of all design components for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to evoke emotions, communicate value, and impact user behaviour. Colour is a non-verbal language that, from a psychological point of view, has the ability to stir up powerful associations and influence mood, feelings, and behaviour. Designers who want to create engaging and significant experiences for their users must understand how colour functions within the framework of UI/UX design. We'll look at the psychology of colour in UI/UX design in this post and discover how colour is used to boost&nbsp;engagement and leave an impression of users.</p>" +
      '<h2>Colour Theory: A Brief Overview</h2>' +
      '<p>Before we delve into the psychology of colour, it is indeed crucial to comprehend the fundamentals of colour theory before delving into the psychology of colour. The framework of colour theory explains how colours interact with one another and how they mix to create new colours. Red, blue, and yellow are the three primary colours, and other colours cannot be combined to make them. Two primary colours can then be combined to make a secondary colour, and two primary colours can be combined to make a tertiary colour.</p>' +
      '<p>Colours can be characterised by hue, saturation, and brightness. The actual colour, for example red, blue, or green, is referred to as hue. The term "saturation" measures the colour&rsquo;s intensity, which can range from brilliant and vibrant to drab and subdued. Brightness refers to how light or dark the colour is, with white being the lightest colour, and black being the darkest.</p>' +
      '<h2>The Psychology of Colour in UI/UX Design</h2>' +
      "<p>With the basic understanding of colour theory, let's explore the psychology of colour in UI/UX design. Each colour has a unique set of associations and can cause users to experience various feelings. Here are some typical connections between various colours:</p>" +
      '<ul>' +
      '<li>Red: Passion, love, anger, danger, urgency</li>' +
      '<li>Orange: Creativity, warmth, enthusiasm, energy</li>' +
      '<li>Yellow: Optimism, happiness, caution, warning</li>' +
      '<li>Green: Growth, nature, harmony, calmness</li>' +
      '<li>Blue: Trust, security, serenity, intelligence</li>' +
      '<li>Purple: Luxury, creativity, spirituality, mystery</li>' +
      '<li>Pink: Femininity, playfulness, love, compassion</li>' +
      '<li>Brown: Earthiness, warmth, stability, reliability</li>' +
      '<li>Black: Elegance, sophistication, power, mystery</li>' +
      '<li>White: Purity, simplicity, cleanliness, innocence</li>' +
      '</ul>' +
      '<p>Such associations could serve as a starting point for designers who want to utilise colour to evoke a particular feeling or meaning even if they are not universal and can change depending on cultural and individual circumstances.</p>' +

      '<li>Use colour to boost branding. Consider employing the brand colours of the company or brand whose design you are creating if you want to maintain a unified aesthetic in all of their documents.</li>' +
      '<li>Make emotional connections. Use colours that are representative of the mood or emotion you want to evoke. For instance, using warm colours like orange and yellow can create a sense of enthusiasm, while cool colours like blue and green can create a sense of peace.</li>' +
      '<li>Use colour sparingly. Using too many colours or using them without careful thought can lead to a confusing and overwhelming design. Choose a small range of colours and employ them consistently throughout your design.</li>' +
      '</ol>' +
      '<h2>Examples of Colour in UI/UX Design</h2>' +
      '<p>Colours have been utilised many times in UI/UX design. Some prominent examples include:</p>' +
      '<ol>' +
      "<li>Dropbox: The colour scheme of Dropbox's website comprises of blue and white colour palette creating a sense of confidence and reliability, while the usage of green in their illustrations and icons conveys growth and innovation.</li>" +
      '<li>Duolingo: To provide a lively and exciting atmosphere, the language learning app uses a bright and cheerful colour scheme to create a sense of fun and excitement.

It symbolises a significant change away from the centralised, proprietary Web2 models and toward a more decentralised, open environment that puts consumers in control of their data and online experiences. Web3 is more than just a technological advancement; it is a new paradigm of online engagement that will enable new types of value creation, collaboration, and creativity.</p>" +
      "<p>In this new Web3 environment, design will be crucial in moulding the user experience and realising the full potential of this technology. In this post, we'll look at the possibilities of Web3 design and how it might help shape the future of online interactions.</p>" +
      '<h2>Designing for a decentralised web</h2>' +
      '<p>Web3 is a set of technologies and protocols that allow decentralised apps (dApps) to run on top of a blockchain network. This means that data is no longer stored in a centralised server, but is instead dispersed throughout a network of nodes owned and controlled by users. This has significant design consequences since it necessitates new approaches to user experience and information architecture.</p>' +
      "<p>One of the most difficult aspects of designing for Web3 is balancing decentralisation and usability. While decentralisation is an important element of Web3, it can also complicate and confuse the user experience. Designers must identify solutions to simplify the user experience while keeping the technology's decentralised character.</p>" +
      '<p>Another critical factor to consider is the necessity to design for trust. Web3 is based on trustless systems, which implies users do not need to rely on intermediaries to conduct online transactions. This necessitates designers creating interfaces that are visible, secure, and simple to use, as well as ensuring that consumers understand the dangers and benefits of utilising these systems.</p>' +
      '<h2>Designing for token economics</h2>' +
      '<p>The rise of new kinds of value generation and exchange is one of the most intriguing features of Web3. Tokens are a major aspect of Web3. They are digital assets that can represent anything from a currency to a utility to a stake in a network. Tokens allow users to join in networks, have access to services, and even control the protocols itself.</p>' +
      "<p>Designers must grasp the importance of tokens in Web3 and create interfaces that make them easy to use. This includes designing for token transactions, managing token balances, and giving information about a network's token economics. Designers must also consider the effects of token economics on user behaviour and create interfaces that encourage good actions.</p>" +
      '<h2>Designing for interoperability</h2>' +
      '<p>One of the primary goals of Web3 is to build a more interoperable web in which diverse apps and networks may connect with one another effortlessly. Designers must think about how their interfaces will interact with other interfaces and networks.</p>' +
      '<p>Designing for diverse blockchain networks and protocols is also part of interoperability. Each blockchain has its own set of unique features and constraints, and designers must be aware of these intricacies in order to create interfaces that work across multiple networks.</p>' +
      '<h2>Designing for community</h2>' +
      '<p>Web3 is more than just a technological upgrade; it is a new paradigm of online interaction based on community and cooperation. Many Web3 initiatives are built around communities, and designers must create interfaces that support community building and interaction.</p>' +
      '<p>This includes creating social elements like messaging, forums, and reputation systems, as well as creating governance and decision-making processes. Designers must also examine how their interfaces might generate a sense of belonging and ownership among community members.</p>' +
      '<h2>Conclusion</h2>' +
      "<p>Web3 is a new online interaction paradigm defined by decentralisation, and new forms of value production and exchange. Design will be crucial in creating the user experience and realising this technology's full potential. Designers must comprehend Web3's unique problems and opportunities in order to design effective and compelling products and services. Web3 design, when approached correctly, may open up new avenues for innovation and growth, revolutionising the way we connect with technology and with one another.</p>",

    html: '<p>The digital revolution of sectors and enterprises has been underway for some time, and it has had a significant impact on the software industry. Digital transformation has emerged as a critical driver of innovation, allowing businesses to produce more efficient and effective products and services. However, in recent years, corporations have recognised sustainability as a vital problem, and the software sector is no different. The convergence of sustainability and digital transformation is opening up new avenues for innovation and growth, and firms who can capitalise on this opportunity will be well positioned to flourish in the future years.</p><p>Sustainability has emerged as a major problem for all types of organisations. With climate change affecting the integrity of ecosystems and populations worldwide, businesses must lower their carbon footprint and adopt more sustainable business practices. This entails rethinking how products are created, produced, and delivered in the software industry. Traditionally, software has been distributed as a tangible object, necessitating large resources for production, shipping, and distribution. However, the emergence of cloud computing and other digital technologies has enabled software to be offered as a service, lowering the software industry&#39;s environmental impact.</p><h2>Data Analytics</h2><p>Data analytics is one of the ways that digital transformation is driving sustainability in the software business. Companies can find areas where they can cut waste and boost efficiency by evaluating data from various sources. Companies, for example, can identify possibilities to cut energy consumption and carbon emissions by evaluating data from data center energy usage. Companies can lower their environmental impact while improving their bottom line by using data analytics to improve resource utilisation.</p><h2>Renewable Energy Sources</h2><p>The usage of renewable energy sources is another way that sustainability is changing the game in current software. As the cost of renewable energy continues to fall, more businesses are using solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources to power their data centers and other facilities. Companies can lower their carbon footprint and improve their environmental profile by embracing renewable energy sources. This not only benefits the environment, but it can also be a selling factor for clients who are becoming more concerned about environmental issues.</p><h2>Circular Economy</h2><p>The emergence of the circular economy has an impact on the software business as well. The circular economy is an economic strategy that aims to reduce waste and maximise resource utilisation. This involves creating products that are more easily recyclable and reusable in the software sector. Businesses can reduce waste and improve their sustainability profile by developing products with circularity in mind. This can also open up new avenues for innovation as companies look for new methods to design more sustainable and ecologically friendly products.</p><h2>Collaboration and Partnerships</h2><p>Finally, sustainability is changing the game in modern software by opening up new avenues for collaboration and collaboration. Companies must collaborate to share knowledge and resources in order to overcome sustainability concerns. As organisations collaborate to develop new technology and solutions, this can open up new avenues for innovation and growth. Companies, for example, can collaborate to build new standards for sustainable software development or to produce new products that are designed to be more sustainable.</p><p>In general, the convergence of sustainability and digital transformation is opening up new avenues for innovation and growth in the software sector. Companies that embrace sustainability can lower their environmental effect while simultaneously enhancing their financial line. As organisations collaborate to address sustainability concerns, this might open up new avenues for collaboration and partnerships. Companies who can leverage the potential of sustainability and digital transformation will be well positioned to succeed in the next years as the software industry evolves.</p>',

      'Embracing Digital Transformation: Strategies to Modernize Legacy Systems and Thrive in the Digital Age',
    hero_src: 'https://source.unsplash.com/MIdLSFHYuMk/1600x900',
    hero_alt: 'colourful projection mapping',
    html: "<p>With the tremendous pace of technology progress, digital revolution has transformed the way businesses work. Many organisations, however, continue to be encumbered by legacy systems that are obsolete, inflexible, and incompatible with the new digital reality. These old systems are commonly referred to as \"dinosaurs\" in today's fast-paced environment because they lack agility, scalability, and resilience. For organisations that want to remain competitive in the digital age, the necessity to modernise or die is increasingly becoming increasingly crucial.</p><p>Legacy systems are often complicated, monolithic, and based on obsolete technology, making them difficult to maintain, upgrade, and integrate with new applications. As a result, these systems can be a major impediment to digital transformation since they impede an organization's agility and flexibility in responding to new market demands, changing consumer expectations, and developing business prospects. Furthermore, because legacy systems are frequently prone to cyber threats and data breaches, they can pose a considerable security risk.</p><p>To address these issues, businesses must implement a modernisation strategy that allows them to transition their outdated systems into contemporary, cloud-native, and resilient architectures. This will necessitate a substantial investment in new technology, people, and procedures that can assist organisations in embracing the future.</p><h2>Strategies to help organisations transform their legacy systems and embrace the future of digital:</h2><h2>Develop a clear roadmap</h2><p>The first stage in modernising old systems is to create a clear roadmap that specifies the modernisation effort's objectives, aims, and priorities. This should involve a detailed assessment of the existing state of the legacy systems, an analysis of the business requirements, and an assessment of the technical feasibility and hazards associated with the modernisation endeavour. The roadmap should also include a detailed plan for the migration process, including dates, resource requirements, and milestones.</p><h2>Adopt a cloud-native approach</h2><p>A cloud-native approach is critical for modernising outdated systems. This strategy entails migrating legacy applications to cloud platforms intended to handle new, distributed architectures. Cloud-native platforms enable organisations to adapt to changing business requirements with the flexibility, scalability, and resilience they require, while minimising the complexity and cost of operating legacy systems. Furthermore, cloud-native platforms provide a diverse set of services and capabilities that can assist organisations in accelerating their digital transformation efforts.</p><h2>Adopt an agile methodology</h2><p>Agile methodology is a collaborative, iterative approach to software development that allows businesses to adjust quickly to changing market demands and consumer needs. This methodology employs cross-functional teams that collaborate closely to build and distribute software in short, iterative cycles. Organisations that use an agile methodology can break down divisions between departments, boost cooperation, and shorten the time-to-market of new apps and services.</p><h2>Invest in DevOps</h2><p>DevOps is a collection of methods that integrates software development and operations to increase software delivery speed, quality, and reliability. Automation, collaboration, and monitoring technologies are used in this method to streamline the software development and deployment process. Organisations that invest in DevOps may expedite the delivery of new apps and features, increase software quality and dependability, and reduce the risk of downtime and outages.</p><h2>Embrace emerging technologies</h2><p>Finally, in order to stay ahead of the competition, businesses must embrace emerging technologies that can help them generate innovation and differentiate themselves. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT) are emerging technologies that can help businesses automate operations, acquire insights from data, and create innovative customer experiences. Organisations may stay ahead of the curve and relevant in the fast-paced digital landscape by embracing these technologies.</p><h2>Final Word</h2><p>To summarise, modernising legacy systems is a technical problem as well as a strategic need for organisations seeking to remain competitive in the digital age. The idea is to start with a clear roadmap that describes the modernisation effort's objectives, aims, and priorities, and then execute the strategy with discipline, agility, and teamwork. The digital future has arrived, and organisations who embrace it will succeed in the new digital landscape.</p>",

Later, you can use tracking codes to tag and track your advertising and your PR or social campaign. With a unique tracking code, Google Analytics tracks all the data on your website.&nbsp;</p><p>Dimensions and metrics are the building blocks of Google Analytics reports. Dimensions are the attributes of data e. g. cities where traffic is coming from and certain pages or social media channels you&#39;re measuring and evaluating with Google Analytics. Metrics are quantitative measurements for dimensions. For instance, if you&#39;re looking at how is your recent ad performing in London, the 10,000 paid sessions you&#39;ve recorded will be your metrics. &nbsp;</p><p>Google Analytics helps you make your marketing decisions based on the provided data. It&#39;s very useful for marketers to prove why they need to invest more money in advertising on certain channels or locations.

This will help you to optimise your website for conversion and place your brand messages strategically so you can achieve better results in the future. As many online business models depend on driving traffic to a page located on a different domain, tracking outbound links will allow you to see which domain converts the best. If you have a landing page you need to drive your traffic to, this is a must-have feature for your business. Also, it allows you to know which parts of your page convert the best. With that information, you can easily replace the elements on that page to engage your visitors even better.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="socialMedia"><strong>3.

Companies all over the world are making millions from their campaigns on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Snapchat. Encouraging your visitors to share your content via social media can bring you new visitors and, potentially, new customers. By tracking social media buttons, you can see which content is valuable to your readers and focus on these topics even more. For instance, you can create eBooks, guides or webinars on that topic and engage your visitors through different types of content.

For instance, if you run a digital marketing agency and the first keyword that led people to your website is &#39;B2B digital marketing&#39;, you should optimise your website so you are at the top of the results on search engines when people search for that particular keyword. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="custom"><strong>5.

    html: '<p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve been running your business successfully for a while now and you want something more. There are so many new markets waiting to be explored and so many new prospects waiting to be converted. Why not take your business to an international level?</p><p dir="ltr">Many businesses will not take this risk because they fear it&rsquo;s too hard to succeed internationally so they will decide not to expand their business. Of course, a business owner has every right to turn down the idea of expansion of its own company, but you should never let fear be your reason for it. If you want to see your company growing and becoming successful in different countries, you should take your business global.</p><p dir="ltr">However, there are ways to do it right and once you decide to expand your business, make sure you start from your website. That&rsquo;s the first place where your potential customers will look for information about your company and not having an international website will have a tremendously negative impact on your success.</p><p dir="ltr">To ensure you take your business globally the right way, we&rsquo;re bringing you 10 keys steps you need to follow if you wish to see your company growing on the global scene, and they are all related to your website. So, let&rsquo;s take a look at what elements should your company website include to attract a completely new audience and engage them on the level that suits them.</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">table of content</h6><ol><li dir="ltr"><a href="#markets">Analyse the markets</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#website">Analyse your website</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#translating">Translating your content</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#calculating">Calculating buyer&#39;s costs and estimating shipping</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#purchasing">Purchasing a domain</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#optimizing">Optimizing your website</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#testing">Testing your speed</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#providing">Providing customer support</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#accounts">Having social media accounts</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#feedback">Asking for feedback</a></li></ol><hr><h3 dir="ltr" id="markets"><strong>1. Analyse the market(s)</strong></h3><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559186699282-1559186699282.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>Before you start working on your international company website, you should analyse the market or markets you&rsquo;re creating that website for. Is your target audience in that country the same as the target audience in your country? There is really a minimum chance that these audiences will be completely identical so it&rsquo;s vital to find factors that differentiate them. That will help you create more precise messages and shape your marketing strategy in a way it fits them completely.</p><p dir="ltr">For instance, the target audience in your country can be women from 22 to 34 years, but in another country it can be women from 26 to 38. This makes a huge difference and knowing it ensures you are not wasting your money and time on a group of people that is not even interested in your products. Also, you should know who your competitors are on this new market, how people feel about them, what are their weak points, and so on. In other words, the same way you analysed the market in your country, you should do it for every other country you wish to be present in with your products.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="website"><strong>2. Analyse your website</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Now that you know what differentiates your potential customers in that country from the customers in your country, you should see what elements of your business displayed on your website you can keep. The messaging will probably have to change at least a bit as one message is rarely equally efficient in several countries. Also, analyse the images and other visual elements you&rsquo;re using on your website to see if they should be replaced with a more adequate ones.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Some countries have very strong cultural differences when compared to others and not including it into your strategies will only harm your business success in that country. Go through each of the pages you have on your website and mark the parts that can stay the same and determine which ones need to change due to a particular reason.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="translating"><strong>3. Translating your content</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re expanding to a new country and want to engage your potential customers there, you will need to talk to them in their own language. Even though your company website might be in English language and your target audience in that country are highly educated individuals who speak English language very good, you should create a website in their language. You should do that for every country you expand to. If you&rsquo;re afraid that the expenses will be too high, you can provide country-specific sites for the countries you are present in.</p><p dir="ltr">Some companies are even employing multi-lingual stuff because their web content changes too often to contact and pay for external translator every time. Other companies will strongly be against translating their website. There are even companies who&rsquo;ve decided to translate only parts of their website and turn it into a landing page created specifically for that target audience. Whatever you choose, make sure it enhances your business results. Of course, you will base your decision on your budget but keep in mind that sometimes, investing a bit more money into translation can bring you an enormous increase in profit. Choose wisely!</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="calculating"><strong>4. Calculating buyer&rsquo;s costs and estimating shipping</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">How much will your product cost in that particular country? It would be ideal if all products cost the same in all countries but due to various taxes and fees, the price of your product can vary from country to country. In case the price will vary significantly, make sure your potential customers know the reasons for it. Not communicating that information on time can have a huge impact on their purchasing decision which will lower your income in these countries.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, if your business has an e-commerce website, you will need to estimate the cost for shipping as shipping internationally will probably be much more expensive than domestic shipping. Here, you will need to take into consideration differences in currencies. To be more precise, you should do your best to calculate your product&rsquo;s landed cost i.e. cost of the product when it arrives in the country with all taxes, fees and other elements. This can be very complex to estimate but should be done if you wish to take your business global in the best way possible.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="purchasing"><strong>5. Purchasing a domain</strong></h3><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559185923261-1559185923261.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>If you wish to be taken seriously by your potential customers in other countries, and we&rsquo;re sure that you do, you will need to think about purchasing domain names for these countries. Domain names can contain a specific site created for that country or direct to pages on your website which are devoted to it. This is a method many international companies utilize but, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s very expensive and complex to implement for small- and middle-sized businesses. However, there is a way to ensure you have your own domain that will ensure you don&rsquo;t lose any of your potential customers in foreign countries. You can set up sub domains or sub folders within the main website domain of your company. The great thing about sub folders is that they also helps you with your ranking on search engines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="optimizing"><strong>6. Optimizing your website</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Your website should be optimized if you wish to attract the traffic from these foreign countries. Optimization is one of the biggest trends with marketers and you should definitely focus on it when taking your business global. With search engines and search ads, you can utilize various techniques to attract these visitors to your website. Above-mentioned domain names can help you significantly with your website optimization but also using keywords is other languages and geo-targeting to certain countries. Also, think about guest posting about your business on relevant platforms in these countries to promote your market entry as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="testing"><strong>7. Testing the speed</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Speed will be one of the determining factors for your new prospects and customers, but keep in mind that having more subdomains or a multilingual website might slow your entire website down. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital that you test it. Start from your desktop computer to check how the website loads for your desktop users. Then, continue testing the speed with your mobile device. After all, the majority of today&rsquo;s Internet users come from their smartphones. Your website should already be mobile-responsive and everything you decide to add on it, should be optimized for mobile as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560334802184-1560334802184.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-shadow"></p><p dir="ltr">As the connection speeds differs depending on the place you&rsquo;re connecting from, you need to do everything to ensure your website is as fast as possible. Your images and other media should be optimized to enhance the loading and downloading time. The more graphics, images, scripts and embeds you have, the slower your website will load which will lead to visitors leaving your site before even seeing any vital information. To test your speed, you can even use some of the free online tools that will immediately tell you your score and some will even suggest what needs to be improved.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="providing"><strong>8. Providing customer support</strong></h3><p>Once your business is running in another country, you will need to think about the customer support you will provide to your customers there. Who will take care of these customers if they have any issues with your product or simply want to learn more about it? It&rsquo;s vital that you have the appropriate staff and also strategy to ensure your target audience can communicate with your business in their own language.</p><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559186306949-1559186306949.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></strong><br>Also, you should think about providing phone numbers and email addresses for that specific audience so they can easily get the information they need. Imagine if your potential customers are thrilled about your product but only need few simple information about it and you haven&rsquo;t provided them with a communication channel. While you were analysing the new market, you should&rsquo;ve discover their preferred communication channels which you will be using.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="accounts"><strong>9. Having social media accounts</strong></h3><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559186181925-1559186181925.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>Having a website without the accompanying social networks is like having a product and not having a company. In today&rsquo;s digital world, website and social media are becoming two sides of the same coin. Social media helps you attract more visitors to your website and close more deals but what to do when expanding to new markets? First, you should know which social media platforms are used by your target audience in different countries. Is it Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or something completely else? Whatever the most popular platforms are, you should be active on them to interact and engage your customers.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="feedback"><strong>10. Asking for feedback</strong></h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559186244758-1559186244758.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Your first few months of entering a new market are crucial. The way your target audience sees your business and products will determine how successful your company will be in that country. You should interact with your customers and prospects from the start and show them their opinion is valuable to you. Ask them what they think about your campaigns, messaging, website, social media platforms, and so on. There is no better way to enhance your business results in that country than talking to your target audience. The sooner you understand which things work and which don&rsquo;t, the easier it will be to shape your efforts to fit this audience&rsquo;s needs.</p><hr><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Analyse the new market to understand better who your target audience is.</li><li dir="ltr">Determine which parts of your website could be used for the new market.</li><li dir="ltr">Translate your content partially or completely depending on your needs, but also consider hiring multilingual staff.</li><li dir="ltr">Calculate how much will the product cost in that country, with taxes and fees, and if you&rsquo;re an e-commerce business, estimate the cost for shipping in that country as well.</li><li dir="ltr">Consider purchasing a new domain name for that new market. The more cost-effective solution is to set up sub domains or sub folders within the main website domain.</li><li dir="ltr">Focus on optimization and think about techniques such as geo-targeting and using keywords in other languages.</li><li dir="ltr">Test your website speed and see how it performs on different devices on different locations.</li><li dir="ltr">Provide customer support to your new target audience to allow them to have all essential information to make a purchase.</li><li dir="ltr">Determine which social media accounts you will have for this new market and communicate actively on them.</li><li dir="ltr">Ask for feedback from the moment you enter this new market to ensure all of your efforts are going in the right direction.</li></ul>',

Mobile access is extremely valuable when it comes to accessing and inputting data while on location. The goal is for the field sales to interest prospects much better.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PwDxdGfOw5ztwDgbQqOCcuQu_tDPYUCTfYn7T3zNwjODGjeZ2O52RacrQZUvmXNjR94Gj5p3PGs1a4YXJCZRWVkPZDGz01y-nVL-Y0xuogPCdQvRCGt_7yN960vgqtoVyBdfz5Hx" width="602" height="448" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="collaborationTools">2.9 Collaboration Tools</h4><p dir="ltr">One of the features you should also think about when talking about CRM solutions is collaboration tools.

Five-step Strategy</h3><p dir="ltr">If you wish to learn the art of driving sales on your company website, first you will need a good strategy. So far, there have been dozens and dozens of strategies promoted as very successful and efficient for businesses. Regardless of the strategy you decide to implement or create from scratch, it will need to consist of five steps that are crucial for driving sales. Of course, it&rsquo;s up to you if you wish to avoid one of the steps but the more of it you cover, the higher the chances for success are.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="startingWithSEO">1.1 Starting With SEO</h4><p dir="ltr">If you wish to build an audience around your website, you will first need to let the people know you have a website and where they can find it. Optimization of your website will show Google and other search engines your website is full of worthy content and you&rsquo;re open for business! As some businesses even report half of their website traffic comes from organic search queries, SEO is something that simply can&rsquo;t be ignored.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Optimizing Content on Your Company Website</h4><p dir="ltr">Determine your keywords and start optimizing your content &ndash; text, videos, photos, infographics, etc. Implement these keywords in your content naturally and you will have more chances to rank on the first page of Google&rsquo;s result page.

Social media, of course. We&rsquo;re all active on at least one social media platform and as a business, you will need to determine most popular social networks for your target audience and start engaging with them there.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Engaging Your Customers and Prospects on Your Social Media Accounts</h4><p dir="ltr">Start posting your content on these social media platforms and you will notice that your customers are looking into your profile. The reason why your customers and prospects will check your social media accounts is that they are more trustworthy than your website. On your website, you can write whatever you want and control what gets published. On the other hand, social media might allow you a certain level of control but the number of likes and comments will highly impact how others see your business.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="emailMarketing">1.3 Engaging Customers through Email Marketing</h4><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re in constant communication with your target audience, it will be much easier to convince them to make a purchase. When you&rsquo;re nurturing the relationship you have with your potential and existing customers, they will feel motivated to purchase your product or service. However, some companies struggle when deciding how they will maintain that constant communication. One of the most sophisticated ways to do it is through email marketing.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Send Regular Email Newsletters to Encourage Sales</h4><p dir="ltr">Create regular email newsletters that will be sent to your customers and prospects, from industry trends to product-related articles that are published on your blog. You can include many useful tips and tricks for them as well. The key is to provide additional value so your audience benefits from your email newsletters and are motivated to proceed to the next stage of your sales funnel.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="sameQualityExperience">1.4 Delivering Same-quality Experience on Various Devices</h4><p dir="ltr">You can&rsquo;t ignore the trends around you. One of the biggest trends is that current customers are mostly doing their online research and even purchases through their smartphones and tablets. Is your website optimized for mobile? If your website fails to deliver a good experience on smartphones or tablets, your sales results will suffer.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Responsive Design and Simple Navigation is Essential</h4><p dir="ltr">Your mobile visitors should enjoy responsive design and simple navigation that will help them find what they want and need. When you&rsquo;re building or re-building your website, always keep in mind that a very big amount of your traffic will come from smartphones and make sure that every aspect of your website is optimized for them as well.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="closingSale">1.5 Closing the Sale</h4><p dir="ltr">Of course, lead generation is crucial if you wish to grow your business but not having the right tools for closing sales will lead to failure. To close the sale, you need the right tools, starting from your online store which needs to work very fast and provide the potential buyers with the information they need to make their decision.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">What Does Your Audience Need to Make up Their Mind?&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">Think about what your audience needs to be more encouraged to proceed onto the next stage. Is it adding mobile payments or investing additional money into securing your payment and checkout?

Here are several tips that will help you with driving sales on your website:</p><p dir="ltr">Be honest and transparent about your pricing on the website. If your prices are not displayed, a significant amount of your potential customers will simply give up immediately while others will be even concerned about the additional costs you might include while they&rsquo;re still doing their online shopping.&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Focus on proving you&rsquo;re trustworthy. If your visitors don&rsquo;t think your business is trustworthy while they&rsquo;re scrolling down your page, you will have a hard time closing the sale. Publish customer testimonials and reviews to improve your trustworthiness.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr">Allowing guest purchases will make it easier for your potential buyers to make an actual purchase as a lot of visitors don&rsquo;t want to bother with creating an account or submitting a lead on your website.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr">When you&rsquo;re targeting customers, don&rsquo;t just target the new ones as the existing customers are much easier to convert. If they were pleased with their first purchase, they are more likely to repeat this experience.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr">Create a loyalty rewards program for your customers. You can shape it however you like, but the goal is to motivate your customers to purchase the product because they will get something in return.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p dir="ltr"><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NVarPZf9eUlCs2o1Z5SdEGW1-NmaNtIGyQcC4uyFs7hQ-RXNDrUm53AgiDLa90s5X3NdSXl23jQ4HetT8oOSaYD78c94FyyCWYdUr9XPG7Ai7BJE_rHX5tpZKnWrLKQhayoIgfk1" width="602" height="329" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="biggestObstacles">3. Biggest Obstacles to Driving Sales on Your Website</h3><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of ways to be successful in driving sales on your website, however, there are also many ways you can unintentionally harm the entire experience for your customers and prospects. Some of them are very obvious while others will seem as if they had nothing to do with driving more traffic and sales to your website. However, if you wish to achieve better results, you will need to avoid doing these things from the beginning. If your website has some of these elements or you are doing something from our list below, make sure you correct it on time.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="slidersHomepage">3.1 Sliders on Your Homepage</h4><p dir="ltr">Many companies have a slider image on their homepage. It allows them to display more visual information in one place and introduce the visitor to different aspects of their business. On the other hand, sliders on your homepage tremendously harm your sales. If your goal is to drives sales on your website, you should remove the sliders right away. When looking from the perspective of driving sales, sliders will confuse your customers and drive them away. Instead, create your website with sales in mind.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="manyPricingPlans">3.2 Displaying Too Many Pricing Plans</h4><p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;ve noticed how diverse your audience actually is and you&rsquo;ve ensured each of them can find a pricing plan that suits them. You might just have three plans but if you didn&rsquo;t point out which of them is popular, you might lose your potential buyer. Highlighting one of these plans as the most popular choice is like social proof that encourages your prospect by letting him know others chose it as well.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="hideContactInfo">3.3 Hiding Your Contact Information</h4><p dir="ltr">How many times have you checked a website and liked its products or services and then, when you noticed there is no contact information, you simply left the website? This is something that the majority of customers will do if they are unable to reach a business and ask for additional information. Not having your contact information is worse than having a bad product. You invested so much of your time into creating your products, then you built your fantastic website but once your customer is interested, you are sabotaging the entire process. Add your contact information immediately if you want to enhance your sales results!</p><hr><h3 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h3><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re focused on driving sales on your company website, you need to start implementing information from our article right away.

    html: '<p>Creating content for your landing page should be tailored not only towards current campaigns in the agenda, but also optimised to develop leads for years to come. But the real struggle is how to ensure that your content is getting hits and generating leads even after you have stopped promotions using calls-to-action, social media and email marketing. Start by enhancing the content for search engines to see a major impact in conversations for the landing page. Read on to discover eleven tried and tested methods to tap into what your consumers want, and translate their interest into conversions.</p><hr><h6>Table of contents</h6><ol><li><a href="#understand">Understand campaign goals or call-to-action</a></li><li><a href="#create">Create upfront headlines that grab users&#39; attention</a></li><li><a href="#craft">Craft a convincing flow of content</a></li><li><a href="#language">Use language that resonates with the user</a></li><li><a href="#graphicsNVisuals">Use appropriate graphics and visuals</a></li><li><a href="#trust">Gain the trust of the user</a></li><li><a href="#employ">Employ irresistible CTAs</a></li><li><a href="#highlight">Highlight your unique value proposition</a></li><li><a href="#ensure">Ensure page loading time is not high</a></li><li><a href="#optimise">Optimise form details to boost lead generation</a></li><li><a href="#testingTools">Use the right testing tools for landing pages matter</a></li></ol><hr><h3 id="understand"><strong>1. Understand campaign goals or call-to-action</strong></h3><p>Figuring out what works with your target audience is essential to mastering how best to position solid campaign goals or calls to action. For instance, if a customer is browsing your landing page for making a purchase and a pop-up asking them to register for the mailing list, might be a distracting experience. Visitors to your website should find it easy to navigate and a hassle-free experience. Keep away from unnecessarily complex language that might confuse the customer.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="create"><strong>2. Create upfront headlines that grab users&#39; attention</strong></h3><p>There&rsquo;s precious seconds to hold your customer&rsquo;s attention when they reach the landing page. This is why your headline must be clear and unique to stand out in the user&rsquo;s mind. Long sentences and technical details might overwhelm a visitor instead of winning them over.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="craft"><strong>3. Craft a convincing flow of content</strong></h3><p>A lot of copy is not needed to convince users regarding your product &ndash; make the content count! In case your brand is offering one of a kind commodities or services, you may have to give a longer explanation to identify it. However, if the items on offer are already familiar to the target audience, you can drive home the key message in seconds.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="language"><strong>4. Use language that resonates with the user</strong></h3><p>To distinguish &ldquo;great content&rdquo; from &ldquo;good content&rdquo;, you need to connect at a deeper level with the visitor and establish a language that is familiar. If your landing page has gripping content, it will create emotions and contribute to the user&rsquo;s memorable experience with the product concerned.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="graphicsNVisuals"><strong>5. Use appropriate graphics or visuals</strong></h3><p>To break the monotony of content, appropriate graphics and visuals can go a long way when it comes to increasing conversations for your landing page. The visual representation of your business message &ndash; photos, drawings, graphics or diagrams -- can help to communicate it more effectively. It is also important to ensure that there aren&rsquo;t too many headers and other elements that take away from the essence of your brand.</p><h3 id="trust"><strong>6. Gain the trust of the user</strong></h3><p>Building trust doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight; some of the biggest brands have spent years focusing on crafting their brand and honing the customer base. If you cultivate consistent messaging and gain a deeper understanding of your buyers&rsquo; profiles, they will also trust you as the go-to provider for their requirements. Delivering on promised quality and timeliness is crucial to build a reputation as a reliable company.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="employ"><strong>7. Employ irresistible CTAs</strong></h3><p>A landing page is incomplete without a proper call to action (CTAs). While it may seem like just a button, it matters for customers to purchase your product. Placing the CTA strategically makes a huge difference in turnovers, for example, the colour of the button should contrast clearly with the landing page background. It should also be positioned in a way that the users&rsquo; eye is drawn to it effortlessly. Most importantly, a sense of urgency or need to grab the specific product/service now, will have a positive impact on the conversion rate.</p><h3 id="highlight"><strong>8. Highlight your unique value proposition</strong></h3><p>The unique value proposition you bring to the table should keep in mind the ideal customer base. There is value only if the language and message connects seamlessly with the customers&rsquo; perceptions of your brand. Customers should be encouraged to use the product or service personally and understand the unique benefits at an individual level. A great way to develop this is by interviewing customers via surveys, tracking social media conversations or focus groups.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="ensure"><strong>9. Ensure page loading time is not high</strong></h3><p>In today&rsquo;s age, users have no patience for delays in loading the landing page. You have a few seconds before they click on another website because of unnecessary load times. Research conducted by Akamai has shown that web users today expect that a website will load within 2 seconds or less. Loading time can severely impact the enthusiasm of consumers to visit your website and view your authentic offerings. Make sure to fast-track this by using the appropriate images for visuals on the page, assessing the web page speed, and by compressing the data.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="optimise"><strong>10. Optimise form details to boost lead generation</strong></h3><p>When thinking about optimising your landing page, one of the more overlooked features is the form details. Once a consumer heeds the call to action &ndash; then what? Having a multi-page form built into the webpage results in users transitioning to leads. The trick is to push a customer to take some steps without requesting any personal details. Once they are committed to following through, you can then mention contact details.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="testingTools"><strong>11. Use the right testing tools for landing pages matter</strong></h3><p>When you are not seeing sufficient lead conversions, consider changing up the strategy with a different call to action, messages, visuals or a more innovative approach. Testing your landing pages occasionally can provide new insights as to the overall performance. Just by assessing a few versions of one page, you can see exceptional improvements in customer conversion rates. Moreover, continuously running A/B tests will help you present relevant content for your consumers.</p><p>A combination of strategies is the best way to implement the process of optimising your landing page. Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of spending money and resources over fragmented approaches to drive traffic to the website. Instead, use these foundational pointers to gain a better understanding of improving your landing page conversion rate across the board.</p>',

Creating Clear and Simple Content for Your Landing Page</h3><p dir="ltr">If a visitor needs more than three seconds to understand what your business is about, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong. The words, images, fonts and the entire landing page design should be utilized in a way to convey your key message to the visitor. If you&rsquo;re wondering how to design a landing page, start with these basic rules:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Avoid creative, buzz words that mean nothing to your visitors.</li><li dir="ltr">If you can say it in one sentence, don&rsquo;t stretch it.</li><li dir="ltr">Include your main keyword in the heading.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">The Importance of the Titles on Your Landing Pages</h4><p dir="ltr">Make sure your title is clear and readable. Of course, you shouldn&rsquo;t avoid playing with words but each word needs to be carefully used within the landing page, from the title to the call-to-action button. Headings which let the visitor know immediately what the landing page is about will ensure the visitor stays longer which helps to convert him.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Landing WordPress Theme: Making it as Simple as Possible&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">This Landing WordPress theme allows its users to navigate in a simple way and enjoy the content on their page.

Don&rsquo;t Forget to Create a Responsive Landing Page</h3><p dir="ltr">Just a few years ago, it was enough to ensure your landing page has a terrific design and functionality to have a successful page.

Bold Background Usage Will Help You Attract More Visitors</h3><p dir="ltr">You might think &lsquo;What does a bold background has to do with my traffic&rsquo;? Well, a lot. Readability is very important for landing pages as it affects the product and business performance. Would you be impacted the same way with a sentence written on a white background and on black? Of course, not. Unfortunately, psychology is not as simple as we like to think it is. When you&rsquo;re choosing colors for your landing page, you have to keep accessibility in mind all the time. Here are a few tips that might help you with that:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Test the fonts, images and icons on different devices before making a decision.</li><li dir="ltr">Different colors inspire different emotions and you should know why you are choosing a particular color.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t forget about the balance between the background and text.&nbsp;</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963055996-1563963055996.png" width="602" height="311" class="fr-fic fr-dii">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="solveWithinHeadline">5. Solve the Problem within the Headline</h3><p dir="ltr">Why should somebody take a look at your product or service? What&rsquo;s in it for them? If you incorporate what problem does your product or service solve, it will engage the visitor and encourage him to sign up. After all, you can&rsquo;t expect a reaction from your visitors if they are unable to recognize the value you provide to them. You need to be aware that a headline can either drive a significant amount of traffic to your landing page or completely destroy the entire experience. Don&rsquo;t neglect its power! Check out the simple example of OptinMonster below.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963056344-1563963056344.png" width="602" height="272" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="provideOptions">6. Provide Your Visitors with Options on Your Landing Page</h3><p dir="ltr">If you want to get more visitors to sign up, but you&rsquo;re uncertain on how to design a landing page to achieve that, start with creating different options for them. Don&rsquo;t go too far and create more than three or four options if you don&rsquo;t want your customers and prospects to get overwhelmed. Instead, create two or three main options for them to click on as soon as they land on your page.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">BuildFire: Simplifying it for the Customers&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">Let them know you understand what they might be interested in and that your business is perfect for either of the provided options. Take a look at a great example by BuildFire, where they created two simple options with captivating images and engaging colors to attract more people to sign up.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963056069-1563963056069.png" width="602" height="395" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="wellStructured">7. Your Landing Page Needs To Be Well Structured</h3><p dir="ltr">Can a visitor notice a hierarchy of the information once he enters your website? Do you know which information needs to be placed at the top and which at the bottom of your landing page? The structure of a landing page is very important. Organizing all the elements in a logical sequence will keep your visitors to scroll down to the bottom of your landing page and also take the right actions while scrolling. Your landing page should have a structure similar to this one:</p><ul><li>Catchy, informative headline</li><li>Engaging photo</li><li>Brief contact form&nbsp;</li><li>Features of your product or service</li><li>Customer testimonials or reviews&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">Codeacademy: Structured Website from Top to the Bottom&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">To sign up for Codecademy&rsquo;s membership, you simply follow the structure on their landing page and you immediately understand where you can get what you need. You have a straight-forward title, concise sentence and a noticeable call-to-action button. Simple as that!</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963056428-1563963056428.png" width="602" height="337" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="connectWithSocialmedia">8. Connect Your Landing Page with Social Media</h3><p dir="ltr">Social media is huge these days. There&rsquo;s truly no reason for you to not include it in your landing page. This way, you can empower your business even more by inviting your customers and prospects to follow you on your social media accounts. When we&rsquo;re talking about social media integration, it means you should integrate your social media buttons to make it easy for visitors to share it or send it to their friends. Also, make sure you find room to place a &lsquo;Follow us&rsquo; link somewhere as well. Just take a look at this great template Monster&rsquo;s Business!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963056867-1563963056867.png" width="380" height="508" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="incorporateVideo">9. Incorporate a Video on Your Landing Page</h3><p dir="ltr">Each time when you&rsquo;re uncertain about how to design a landing page, why not try and say it all with a video? Video is one of the biggest trends right now not only in marketing but in the entire business world. Companies are utilizing it to increase the engagement and conversion rates on various profiles, so why not implement it on your landing page?&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Outbrain: Explaining Products With Video Content</h4><p dir="ltr">Determine what your key messages are and start delivering them through video. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to mention that Google and other search engines adore video and will always place websites with video higher than the ones that don&rsquo;t have video content at all. You can even customize your call-to-action just like Outbrain did!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963056510-1563963056510.png" width="602" height="343" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="FAQsection">10. Use a FAQ Section to Save Visitors&rsquo; and Your Time</h3><p dir="ltr">If you neglect the importance of having a FAQ section on your landing page, you could risk having hundreds of people reaching out for additional information. To prevent this from happening, you should think about the most common questions your customers and prospects might ask and answer them all.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Drift: Increasing Conversions and Building Trust With FAQ</h4><p dir="ltr">Did you know that FAQ sections increase conversions and trust among your target audience? The more transparent you are about your product or service, the more will people believe you. And in sales, you can&rsquo;t expect to close a deal without trust. Follow the example by Drift and start building that trust!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563963056144-1563963056144.png" width="602" height="348" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p>',

To make your social media marketing strategy even more effective, choose those platforms you know your target audience uses the most.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="blog">6. Run a blog</h3><p>If you provide your prospects with additional value in the form of a blog, be sure they will appreciate it. Writing about industry trends and challenges, the benefits of your products and ways to utilize it or something similar will significantly contribute to your customer acquisition results. Also, publishing your content regularly will help you raise brand awareness, build an audience around the blog and improve your ranking on search engines. &nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="guestPlaforms">7. Posting on guest platforms</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559106599715-1559106599715.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Social media and your website are not the only places where you can publish your content. By having someone else publish your article, you will be able to reach a completely new audience. After all, the more people hear about your business, the more customers you will be able to acquire. Start reaching out to those websites that would be interested in publishing your content and engage their audience with a compelling, interesting article.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="repurposingContent">8. Repurposing content</h3><p dir="ltr">Do you remember those old posts that were quite popular when you&rsquo;ve published them? Well, revise them once more and decide how you will repurpose that content. You can create a guide, eBook, webinar, newsletter, infographics or anything else, as long as you have a clear idea on how you will promote it to find new customers. With this in-depth content, companies usually ask for emails and names of the people who wish to access the content. When you&rsquo;ve gathered these email addresses, you can start interacting with the people from the list.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="newsletters">9. Sending newsletters</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559104934160-1559104934160.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" style="width: 307px;">It&rsquo;s probably one of the oldest techniques on our list but newsletters are still highly effective. Newsletters are straight to the point, informative and can be very creative and dynamic. Not to mention that you can create multiple campaigns and have one just for those who are your potential customers. Adjusting the message to help them make their purchase decision is the goal of every newsletter and email campaign. Write from their point of view and don&rsquo;t forget to include a call to action.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="">10. Writing press releases</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559103972612-1559103972612.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">You&rsquo;ve just partnered up with another company to work on a multi-million project or you&rsquo;ve already surpassed your sales goals for this year? Anything that provides relevant and recent information about your business is newsworthy. Sending it to media can open even new opportunities such as a follow-up interview in a well-known magazine or invitations to important events. Seeing an article about your company in the newspaper or online will intrigue people to look up more information about your business.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="ppcCampaign">11. Investing in PPC campaign</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559103847696-1559103847696.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to see immediate results from your customer acquisition strategy? To achieve that, you will have to invest in a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign that is tailored to fit the needs of your target user. The most important thing you need to keep in mind when organizing a PPC campaign is that it&rsquo;s an ongoing process. In other words, you will need to constantly analyse and optimize if you want your campaign to be successful and bring you new customers.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="subscriberList">12. Emailing someone else&rsquo;s subscriber list</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559104049105-1559104049105.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">By finding companies which have an admirable email list, you could extend your reach to a new audience. For instance, you can ask them how much they would charge if you want to send your email to their subscriber list. Create an email specifically for this occasion and make it more appealing to that particular audience. By tracking the conversion rate, you will be able to see if it worked.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="videos">13. Creating videos</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559100788490-1559100788490.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Videos are the most engaging type of content, regardless of the platform you choose for publishing. Video increases your engagement rate which helps you convert those viewers into leads and finally, those leads into customers. Nothing can captivate as well as videos, so ensure to make them as informative and interesting as possible. The only thing worse than neglecting the power of video is to record videos that will not achieve the results you need.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="affiliateProgram">14. Setting up an affiliate program</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559104787034-1559104787034.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil">Setting up an affiliate program will allow you to send referral links to influential people or companies in your industry. These people will promote your products or services and provide that link to their audience and in return, you will pay them each time someone signs up to your product. You can contact as many people you want to promote your business that way to enhance your results.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="influencerMarketing">15. Investing in influencer marketing</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559100995693-1559100995692.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Due to the power of social media, there has been a significant rise in the number of influencers who have built their own audiences and have the potential to affect their purchase decisions. Understanding who influences your prospects can help you direct your acquisition efforts that way. Make sure you introduce them to your products or services as they will not recommend something to their audience just because you&rsquo;ve asked them to.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="freeAquisition">16. Focusing on free acquisition</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559104357549-1559104357549.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Your satisfied customers have the potential to acquire new customers. Encourage them to share links to your website, invite their friends to join or send a discount for sign up. Each of these ways will result in an organic acquisition where your customers will do all the work for you. Depending on the nature of your business, find the most effective way and implement it somewhere where each of your customers will see it.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="keywords">17. Ranking for certain keywords</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559101575930-1559101575930.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">If you&rsquo;ve already optimized your website, you&rsquo;ve also determined the keywords you want to rank for on the search engines. These keywords will help you attract those users who search for your keywords and look for solutions. Having a way to interact with somebody who has shown interest in what you&rsquo;re selling will improve your acquisition chances.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="quoraQuestions">18. Answering Quora questions</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559102117854-1559102117854.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" style="width: 433px;">How many times have you tried to find an answer and ended up on Quora reading posts from various people? Quora is a fantastic place to promote your business and interest people in your products and services. As you will probably find a question related to your business, answer it in an informative way and mention your company as a solution. Remember, people visit Quora to find answers, so make sure your company is one of the answers.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="promoCode">19. Creating promo codes</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559102194093-1559102194093.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Promo codes are highly effective with B2C companies, but B2B companies are also increasingly using them in the past few years. That element of action where a prospect needs to use the code before it expires is what will acquire new customers. Even a small discount code of 10% can result in an excellent acquisition rate. It&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to engage both existing and new customers.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="organize">20. Organize contests and giveaways</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559102258265-1559102258265.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">With the appearance of social media, contest and giveaways have become very popular across various industries. The reason for that is their incredibly high engagement rate as your followers start liking, commenting and sharing the contest post. More importantly, that increases the chances of people who are not your followers to engage with your content and become your customers as well.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="partnering">21. Partnering up with another company</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559104692564-1559104692564.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">There are plenty of ways you can partner up with another company, from having a joint webinar to producing a joint product for both of your audiences. When you become a partner with a company, you will start helping each other to improve your business results. That means you can post each other&rsquo;s content, send emails to each other&rsquo;s subscriber list, provide each other with valuable insights, etc. This is something that will also have a positive impact on your overall brand image.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h4><p dir="ltr">It was much harder to acquire customers before when you didn&rsquo;t have all of these techniques at your disposal. Now, you can engage with so many people online and all you have to do is to create something they will find valuable enough to become your customers. In the end, you can&rsquo;t maintain your business success without satisfying your customers and finding new ones.&nbsp;</p>',

    html: '<p dir="ltr">Customers are what makes your company running. No matter how great your product or service is, you can&rsquo;t be successful without customers. Customers are incredibly vital for B2B companies as they need to try even harder to convert their prospects into customers. That also means that B2B leads are harder to get when compared to B2C leads, but it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p><p dir="ltr">Businesses that have the right methods and tools at their disposal can generate a significant amount of leads and take their inbound marketing strategy to the next level. Compared to five or ten years ago, the methods used today are very different. From content marketing, video marketing, case studies, blogs to social media platforms, businesses are able to engage their prospects more quickly and efficiently.</p><p dir="ltr">To help you generate more quality B2B leads for your business that will eventually become your loyal customers, we&rsquo;ve decided to create the ultimate inbound marketing guide which contains all the information you need. Start utilizing some of our suggestions on generating B2B leads and transform your sales and marketing strategy.</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">Table of contents</h6><ol><li><a href="#enhance">Enhance your lead generation and revenue</a></li><li><a href="#onlineBuyers">Your B2B buyers are online</a></li><li><a href="#emailContacts">Emailing your contacts</a></li><li><a href="#runBlog">Running a blog</a></li><li><a href="#targetedAdvertising">Using targeted advertising</a></li><li><a href="#socialNetwork">Utilizing social networking</a></li><li><a href="#landingPages">Creating landing pages</a></li></ol><hr><h3 dir="ltr" id="enhance"><strong>1. Enhance your lead generation and revenue</strong></h3><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559108496211-1559108496211.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>If you could increase your number of leads, you will have a higher income. Simple as that! Each new email address is a lead that has value for your business. Of course, not every lead will be equally valuable to you, but the more leads you have, the easier it will be to improve your conversion rate. For instance, if you manage to generate 10% more leads than last month, and they are all quality leads, you will make 10% more income this month.</p><p dir="ltr">You can&rsquo;t tell which of the information you gather, whether its email address or company name, will provide value to your company. Moreover, it&rsquo;s difficult to predict what this lead may be interested in. Some people will maybe subscribe to your newsletter and enjoy your weekly updates, and others might purchase your product. As you never know, it&rsquo;s crucial that you focus on gathering quality leads that will be interested in something your company can offer them.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to increase your income, you will have to take lead generation very seriously and dedicate your time to generating B2B leads for your company. Lead generation is one of the most vital processes for every business and you should know about some of the most efficient lead generation tactics.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="onlineBuyers">2. Your B2B buyers are online</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559108596103-1559108596103.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">First, you need to be aware of one fantastic advantage B2B leads have over B2C leads &ndash; almost every of your potential buyer is online. As B2B customers are researching online before making a purchase decision, they will visit your website and your social media accounts. This means all of your marketing and sales efforts should be based online. Invest in your online marketing strategy as it has the biggest potential to deliver the results your business needs and deserves.</p><p dir="ltr">If you miss out on the chance to engage your customers on online platforms, they will move on to the next supplier who provides a similar or the same solution. You should attract your customers to come to visit your website and other platforms where you&rsquo;re active, provide them with useful content and start communicating with them through various interaction channels. If you neglect this fact, your number of leads will suffer and, consequently, your overall sales figures.</p><p dir="ltr">However, this shouldn&rsquo;t intimidate you if you still haven&rsquo;t focused on your online marketing efforts. Start improving your website and your social network so your target audience can find the information they are looking for and make the right decisions. Then, when you&rsquo;re ready, start generating those B2B leads.</p><p dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at techniques that can help you generate quality B2B leads to help you understand which of them are perfect for your company. Keep in mind that you don&rsquo;t have to implement all of our ideas at once. Instead, pick a few ideas from our list and make the most of them.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="emailContacts">3. Emailing your contacts</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559108706446-1559108706446.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" style="width: 693px;">Email address is the most common lead businesses usually gather through lead generation. With email, you can quickly and effectively start with digital lead generation. Use the contact list you have to email your target audience. Many businesses are hesitant to this method as they wrongly assume it&rsquo;s the same thing as spam. Lack of information and poor communication in an email makes it spam. If you know how to craft a sharp, focused email, you will be able to engage all these people who enjoy receiving a useful email.</p><p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t stand by and just assume your contacts don&rsquo;t want to hear from you via email because it&rsquo;s not true. While you&rsquo;re not utilizing email as your lead generation channel, your competitors are already converting their email contacts into customers. You can&rsquo;t expect someone to become your loyal customers if they are not aware of your business or what you could provide to them. Keep in mind, it&rsquo;s better to annoy a few customers out of thousands than having thousands of them who don&rsquo;t even who what your business is about.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="runBlog">4. Running a blog</h3><p dir="ltr">Having content on your blog will be beneficial to your business in so many ways. You can inform your target audience about your new products or features, increase your brand awareness, but you can also generate B2B leads by having a blog. When you create a quality, well-informed content or your target audience, it can even go viral. If others recognize your blog post as something useful for their readers, they will include your article on their platform. This can gather a lot of new leads while it strongly enhances your online reputation.</p><p dir="ltr">In the B2B world, blog articles serve as a source of new information, industry overviews, suggestions and opinions. This helps educate the B2B customers about certain topics they are interested. Start publishing your articles regularly and provide your readers with an option to subscribe to your blog. The better your blog content is, the more leads you will gather.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="targetedAdvertising">5. Using targeted advertising</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559108783581-1559108783581.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Many businesses across various industries utilize digital advertising to achieve their marketing and sales goals. However, targeted advertising can also help you with generating leads. If you want to expand your audiences and get leads outside your database, this is the right method for it. With targeted advertising, you have an endless list of targeting capabilities. Depending on your needs, you can choose industries, companies, job titles, ages, locations, interests, and other elements to make your advertising more precise. This is a very cost-effective solution as you&rsquo;re paying for an ad that will be advertised to your chosen set of people. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When you&rsquo;re creating an ad for online platforms, make sure the design and the copy fit the profile of the ad&#39;s targeted audience. Create it with them in mind as it will help you generate more B2B leads. Provide them with a clear solution that will captivate their attention in the sea of online information.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="socialNetwork">6. Utilizing social networking</h3><p dir="ltr">Social media is one of the most recent methods to generate B2B leads as it is a relatively new trend in the marketing world. But, even though these are new platforms for businesses to engage and convert their followers, their impact is unquestionable. Now, there are numerous social networks that can help you enhance interactions with your customers are prospects, such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and Youtube.</p><p dir="ltr">Depending on your products or services, you can find pages or groups where people post and discuss various topics. From social media advertising to regular status updates, you can easily engage your audience and consequently nurture quality B2B leads. Don&rsquo;t hesitate from using chat or responding to comments as it&rsquo;s one of the most efficient ways to convert followers into quality leads.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="landingPages">7. Creating landing pages</h3><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559108901113-1559108901113.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Another popular way to generate B2B leads is by creating a landing page specifically for your potential customers. The great thing about landing pages is that you can direct them to a central location from any other online place &ndash; blog, email, newsletter, social media, etc. With a landing page, you can demonstrate to your target audience your strengths and show them why they should purchase your product or service. Not to mention that you can also promote webinars, eBooks, guides any other related content that is useful for your business in some way.</p><p dir="ltr">Your landing page should be very easy to read and you should only provide vital information. Explain the purpose of the page, why your prospects need what you&rsquo;re offering and, in the end, add a call-to-action message. Keep in mind that a landing page without a call-to-action message is like crafting a sales pitch without the ask. Make it as engaging as possible!</p><hr><h4 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h4><p dir="ltr">The one thing you have to know about lead generation is that something that works for your competitor may not work for you. One company can generate thousands of leads through emails, while others will not be able to generate even tens of them. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that you experiment with all the ideas mentioned in this guide.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, you can try them all but don&rsquo;t try them all at once. Once you determine what works for your business, see what other efforts can be invested in it to truly make the most of it and generate as many B2B leads as possible.</p>',

To grow your business and enhance your online reputation, you need a significant number of visitors on your website.

First, it will indicate what is good and what is bad about your business. You can track all of your marketing efforts in real time without having to wait for a certain period of time to see how well your strategies are working.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Second, website traffic reveals valuable information about your audience that can help you make better business decisions in the future.

Optimizing your website for search engines</h4><p dir="ltr">The higher your website ranks on the search engine result page (SERP), the more user clicks it will enjoy. As Google and other search engines suggest results based on user search inquiry, users will more likely click on the first few results on the first page. Search engine optimization is vital to attracting new people to your website. To optimize for search engines, you should create a list of relevant keywords, publish quality content with clear title tag and meta description and, most importantly, update your content regularly.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535501394-1559535501394.png" width="602" height="401" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-fil"></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="targeting">2. Targeting long-tail keywords when creating content</h4><p dir="ltr">When talking about the optimization of your website, you should already be familiar with long-tail keywords. It&rsquo;s a specific keyword phrase with a lower search volume but higher chances of converting. You will definitely enjoy a higher ranking on search engines if you target long-tail keywords. This also helps to attract those visitors who are truly interested in your products or services and, are therefore, easier to convert.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="creating">3. Creating viral content will attract a lot of new visitors</h4><p dir="ltr">We&rsquo;ve all seen viral content, whether on social media or any other platform. It&rsquo;s the type of content that has a high engagement rate due to its short duration and topicality. Viral content is based on the strong emotional connection it has with the audience who want to share it with others. As there is no magic formula that promises your content&#39;s virality, you will need to research what works best for your audience if you want to enjoy that enormous boost in your traffic.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="headlines">4. Creating captivating headlines for your content</h4><p dir="ltr">Headlines shouldn&rsquo;t be important just for the articles you publish on your blog. A corporate website uses headlines when optimizing for search engines, posting on social media, creating subpages or landing pages, and many other places. When crafting these headlines, make them informative and intriguing. Don&rsquo;t create headlines that will create a fuss for no reason as you will lose more visitors than you&rsquo;ll be able to attract.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="focusing">5. Focusing on guest blogging to attract a new audience</h4><p dir="ltr">Guest posts are one of the most efficient ways to attract a completely new audience that could be very interested in what you have to offer. When crafting your guest blogging strategy, aim for platforms that have higher traffic than your website. Depending on your agreement with this platform, you can even insert a link to your website in one of their existing articles or simply provide their readers with an informative and engaging post about your business. As you start posting on other platforms, you will see almost an immediate traffic boost.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="socialMedia">6. Using social media posts to drive traffic to your website</h4><p dir="ltr">All of your potential customers are active on at least one social media platform. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s only logical to expect that businesses will do their best to attract more visitors to their website from social media platforms. If you want to engage your followers, start posting your recent news or products and interact with them frequently. When posting, add personality and creativity to catch the attention of your audience. Make your posts interactive and always encourage your followers to comment so you can continue interacting with them.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535502078-1559535502078.png" width="602" height="401" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="evergreen">7. Creating evergreen content will never get old</h4><p dir="ltr">All content is great if it provides value to your audience, but having evergreen content on your website will deliver exactly what all companies want: long-term traffic. Creating evergreen content means you will be able to enjoy traffic months or even years after your content is published. So, what is actually evergreen content? It can be articles, infographics, images or videos that are valuable to your audience today and tomorrow. However, don&rsquo;t expect a huge boost from this type of content as they are almost the opposite of viral content. The value of evergreen content is that it will attract visitors who are not difficult to convert.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="investing">8. Investing in your email marketing strategy</h4><p dir="ltr">The same way you can attract your social media followers to your corporate website, you can do it with your email subscribers. Focus on your email marketing and create content that will interest them enough to visit your website. You can start by welcoming all your new subscribers and then regularly inform your customers and prospects about new products, discounts and other updates. Email marketing is a very efficient way to engage your audience, so you should definitely create several outreach emails for different purposes.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535499482-1559535499482.png" width="602" height="276" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="syndicating">9. Syndicating content widens your content exposure</h4><p dir="ltr">Similar to guest posting, syndication can widen your content exposure to people who have never heard of your business before. When syndicated on high-authority websites, such as Fast Company or Business Insider, it helps businesses direct a huge number of new visitors who want to learn more about your business and your products or services. Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s not always easy to build a relationship with editors on such high-authority websites, so you might consider starting with the ones that have lower authority.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="internalLinking">10. Internal linking brings your website enormous benefits</h4><p dir="ltr">Linking internally helps navigate your visitors from one piece of content to another one, depending on their needs and preferences. For instance, if you&rsquo;re writing about your new product and explaining its features and benefits, you should definitely include a link to your page where visitors can purchase that product. Talking about something and not providing your potential customers with a way to extend their experience on your website will confuse your visitors, increase your bounce rate and reduce your possibility to convert.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535499685-1559535499685.png" width="602" height="247" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="quora">11. Posting on forums like Quora</h4><p dir="ltr">How many times have you tried to search for a certain keyword and Quora was among the top results? The reason for that is many businesses will utilize a forum like Quora to promote their business and attract new visitors to their website. Find questions on Quora that are relevant to your business, create quality content and publish it as an answer. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t add too many links in your posts. Make it informative rather than promotional. The more information you provide, the higher the chances are somebody is going to visit your website.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="updating">12. Updating old content</h4><p dir="ltr">The articles on your blog should be updated frequently. Not just the ones that discuss industry trends for the previous year but all of them. If you find new information about something and think it would fit some of your old posts, update it. You can also update with photos, videos, infographics or any other type of content related to that topic. When updating your old content, you will increase its exposure, improve your search engine ranking and, consequently, boost traffic on your website.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="thirdParty">13. Getting listed on third-party review sites</h4><p dir="ltr">Today&rsquo;s buyers will research what others have to say about your business before making a purchase decision. They will visit third-party review sites to see your score and go through various customer reviews. Being mentioned on these websites builds trust and credibility and it will encourage your prospects to become your customers. Find review sites that are relevant for your business, open an account and start interacting with users there.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535500485-1559535500485.png" width="602" height="392" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr">14. Repurposing content to create something new</h4><p dir="ltr">You probably already know which of your blog articles were very successful with your readers, so why not repurpose them and boost your website traffic that way? There are so many other types of content you can create from your old articles, such as infographics, podcasts, webinars, eBook, guides, etc. The options are truly limitless, so you should never neglect the power of your existing content as it can still get you a huge amount of new visitors.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="hosting">15. Hosting giveaways and contest on your platforms</h4><p dir="ltr">Have you ever wondered why so many businesses host giveaways or contests on their website or social media platforms? It&rsquo;s a very simple tactic to generate traffic while also boosting engagement. Use all of your platforms to promote the giveaway or contest to increase the traffic numbers as much as possible. The best thing about them is they are very easy to organize and can be repeated numerous times.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="affiliate">16. Focusing on affiliate marketing strategy</h4><p dir="ltr">If you still haven&rsquo;t tried out affiliate marketing, maybe you will give it a shot after you realize it&rsquo;s the perfect way to attract a new audience from someone else&rsquo;s platform. You can reach out to influencers of your industry or businesses which would be interested in collaborating with your company. By providing them with a unique tracking code, you will be able to see how many new visitors are coming from these platforms. Also, you can provide them with a special discount to encourage their audience to shop while the discount is still active. Affiliate marketing is something that you can do this with an endless number of people and companies, as long as they&rsquo;re providing you with the results you want.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535500233-1559535500233.png" width="602" height="403" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="offering">17. Offering samples to bloggers and influencers</h4><p dir="ltr">Similar to affiliate marketing, you can partner up with bloggers and influencers in your industry to promote your products or services. For instance, if you&rsquo;re selling a mobile app, you can give them free access to it in exchange for a promotional blog article on their website and social media platforms. In case you&rsquo;re selling physical products, you can offer samples. This will bring your social credibility, new followers on social media and more traffic to your website as well.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="sponsoredContent">18. Investing in sponsored content</h4><p dir="ltr">This method will require spending more money but it&rsquo;s very efficient with many businesses. Investing in a sponsored post on another platform will guarantee your article will be published where you want and how you want. With guest blogging, you will need to invest a lot of time until you find the platform that&rsquo;s willing to publish your content. When paying for your content to be published, you will skip all that convincing and be able to focus on creating quality content.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="onlineCourses">19. Creating online courses on certain topics</h4><p dir="ltr">When you create long-form content, such as courses, you are able to provide your audience with more in-depth information and educate them on certain topics. By promoting your online course, you can extend your reach to other people who might be interested in this particular topic. You can even create a specific landing page for it and engage your visitors even more with a carefully chosen information.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="infographics">20. Launching and promoting your infographics</h4><p dir="ltr">Info-graphics are a type of content with a very high conversion rate. With a skillful designer, you can create really engaging infographics that will approach a certain topic differently than blog articles or social media posts. When you create these graphics that are showing a problem-solving story to your audience, make sure you promote it on your social media networks and ask other platforms to include it in their articles on that topic.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559535500730-1559535500730.png" width="602" height="232" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="podcast">21. Giving podcast interviews</h4><p dir="ltr">Over the last few years, podcasts have become highly popular with audiences across various industries. So, why not give a podcast interview to a local or industry-related show? It&rsquo;s a great way to demonstrate your target audience what is your business about and why they need to know about it. Podcast will help you bring your business closer to your potential customers. Those who are interested will undoubtedly go and check your website for further information.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="influential">22. Publish an interview with an influential person on your blog</h4><p dir="ltr">You probably already know which people are leaders in your company. They are those individuals who have their own blogs, publish their opinion on industry-related topics and enjoy a lot of website traffic. Asking that person for an interview and publishing it on your blog will bring you a lot of new visitors. Don&rsquo;t forget to ask them to promote it on their social media platforms to boost the traffic even more.</p><hr><h4 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h4><p dir="ltr">As you can see, there are plenty of ways to drive traffic to your corporate website, but keep in mind not all of them will be efficient for you. Start testing them and once you discover which of them work, start utilizing them so your business can truly benefit from them.&nbsp;</p>',

    html: '<p dir="ltr">To achieve great email marketing results, you will need to have a decent number of email subscribers who are engaged on a regular basis. As almost every business struggles to acquire new subscribers, especially in the beginning, it&#39;s vital to find efficient ways to create emails that convert and enable you to maintain a meaningful relationship with your prospects and customers.</p><p dir="ltr">Even with the rise of social media and other digital platforms, email marketing is still standing strong. Up to<a href="https://seoexpertbrad.com/email-marketing-statistics-2019/">&nbsp;60% of people</a> say their purchase decisions are strongly influenced by email marketing. In other words, not only is the email one of the most popular communication channels among customers, but it is also a fantastic tool for driving sales. This allows businesses to make the most out of these emails and provide their target audience with information they need to make a purchase decision.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what kind of copy and design have the strongest possibility to captivate the attention of your website visitors? There are several strategies that have proven to be very successful in encouraging customers to sign up to business newsletters. Before we reveal to you some of the best newsletter sign up practices in the business world, let&rsquo;s take a look at how to provide your audience with exactly what they need.</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">Table of Contents</h6><p>1. <a href="#customerPOV">Customer&#39;s point of view</a></p><p>2. <a href="#newsletterStrategies">10 best newsletter sign up strategies</a></p><ol><li><a href="#spoongraphics">Spoon graphics: Highlight your incentives</a></li><li><a href="#boast">Boast: Discount vs full price approach</a></li><li><a href="#privy">Privy: Using the one form field</a></li><li><a href="#madfientist">Mad fientist: Creating a pop-up form</a></li><li><a href="#wistia">Wistia: Sign up form with various choices</a></li><li><a href="#backlinko">Backlinko: Using social proof</a></li><li><a href="#katespade">Katespade: Combining simplicity and creativity</a></li><li><a href="#hustlepanda">Hustle Panda: Specifying the email marketing content</a></li><li><a href="#bizchix">BizChix: Focusing on design</a></li><li><a href="#launchRock">LaunchRock: Creating minimalistic sign up page</a></li></ol><hr><h3 dir="ltr" id="customerPOV">1. Customer&#39;s point of view</h3><p dir="ltr">However, we can&#39;t talk about the best practices if you didn&#39;t take time to learn more about your target audience. To run an email marketing campaign which will deliver you the results you want, you have to understand what your audience needs and find a way to deliver it to them through email marketing.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who are subscribed to your newsletter have already shown you they want to receive more information about your business. If someone is interested in your business, you have the opportunity to engage that person on a completely new level. There is so many valuable pieces of information your newsletter subscribers can provide you with, you just have to know how to ask for it.</p><p dir="ltr">For instance, you can offer them an incentive for a signup, such as a coupon or upgrade. A good idea would be to announce how often you will send emails to your subscribers as a lot of people are hesitant to give away their email addresses due to email spam. Also, don&#39;t forget to make your call-to-action message short and clear. The most common ones are &lsquo;Send&rsquo;, &lsquo;Subscribe&rsquo;, &lsquo;Get Started&rsquo;, &lsquo;Join Us&rsquo;, but also consider adding the ones that highlight the value for your customers, such as &lsquo;Join Free for a Month&rsquo;, &lsquo;Try our Free Features&rsquo;, &lsquo;Claim your free guide&rsquo;, etc.</p><p dir="ltr">To get inspired and find the right idea for your business, we&#39;ve compiled 10 newsletter sign up strategies used by top brands which ensured them more than 100,000 email subscribers. But, before you start crafting your newsletter strategy, take time to understand what will be valuable to your audience and then find a way to deliver it to them.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="newsletterStrategies">2. 10 Best Newsletter Sign Up Strategies</h3><p dir="ltr">There are many elements that will determine whether your strategy will convert your recipients into customers, but the most vital ones are copy and design. The way you communicate your brand is what can help you gain more email subscribers, close more deals, build and spread your brand awareness and achieve better business results in general. Here are some of the strategies that have proven to be very beneficial so far.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="spoongraphics">2.1 Spoon Graphics: Highlight your incentive</h4><p dir="ltr">Highlighting the signing up benefits for your target audience is what will definitely help you collect more email addresses. If a person has to leave their email address, they will expect something in return. Not saying what it is right away can cost you a potential customer as people don&rsquo;t leave their information without knowing the reason for it. Decide what the incentive will be, depending on the nature of your business and the profile of your audience, and communicate it in your sign up form or page.</p><p dir="ltr">Below is the example of Spoon Graphics where they&rsquo;ve clearly stated that every email subscriber will get a free resource bundle and more than 100 vectors, brushes, logos, and other graphic design tools. It&rsquo;s simple, captivating and straight to the point!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115127726-1559115127726.png" width="328" height="394" class="fr-fic fr-dii">&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="boast">2.2 Boast: Discount vs. full price approach</h4><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;ve decided that your every email subscriber will enjoy a certain discount for the first purchase, you should emphasize that in your sign up form. As money is one of the determining factors for purchase, your customers will surely appreciate the discount and will gladly provide you with their email address. However, if you do a comparison of a discount and a full price, you will leave an even stronger impact on them.</p><p dir="ltr">Boast decided to use this strategy to attract more people to sign up for their newsletter. They offered 20% discount for the first order and below wrote an effective sentence &ldquo;No thank you, I prefer paying full price&rdquo;, which automatically recommends you to choose the option with the discount.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115128445-1559115128445.png" width="598" height="379" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="privy">2.3 Privy: Using the one form field</h4><p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve probably seen a lot of sign up forms with several fields you need to fill out if you wish to click that &lsquo;Sign Up&rsquo; button below. This will definitely reject a lot of your website visitors who don&rsquo;t want to give away too much information or don&rsquo;t have time to fill out all the fields.</p><p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s why Privy has decided to use a one-field sign up form where their visitors can simply and quickly subscribe without unnecessarily complicating the entire process. After all, their email address is everything you actually need at this moment. Later, you can ask them for their name and anything else that might help you personalize your newsletters.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115127539-1559115127539.png" width="518" height="320" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="madfientist">2.4 Mad Fientist: Creating a pop-up form</h4><p dir="ltr">Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to place your sign up form so it captures the attention of your website visitors. That&rsquo;s why a pop-up window is an excellent solution to captivate your visitors when they enter your website. This way, you will know that every person who was on your site was asked to subscribe to your newsletter.</p><p dir="ltr">Mad Fientist has decided to create their form this way but they&rsquo;ve also provided benefits for their subscribers in the form. With a &lsquo;Join Now!&rsquo; button below only two fields, their visitors can easily complete the sign up process and enjoy the same benefits as their other subscribers.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115127486-1559115127486.png" width="466" height="324" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="wistia">2.5 Wistia: Sign up form with various choices</h4><p dir="ltr">As every customer is different, their needs and expectations from your brand will differ as well. Some might prefer to receive a weekly overview of trends in the industry, while others might want daily tips on how to make the most of your product. By giving them a choice, they will be in control of what comes into their email inbox. Many people don&rsquo;t subscribe to newsletters as they fear they will receive the information they aren&rsquo;t interested in, but by giving them an option to choose the type of the newsletter they want to receive, you will be able to collect more addresses.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the companies which are aware of the efficiency of this strategy is Wistia. They&rsquo;ve decided to allow their subscribers to choose their preferences and enjoy a personalized email experience. This also increases the engagement rate as your subscribers will only receive what they need so they will be more motivated to read your newsletters and purchase from you.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115127232-1559115127232.png" width="602" height="337" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="backlinko">2.6 Backlinko: Using social proof</h4><p dir="ltr">With social proof, you can demonstrate your potential subscriber how many of subscribers you already have. For instance, if you have 100,000 subscribers who love to read your weekly updates, this one might love it as well. Letting your website visitors know how many subscribers you have will show them you bring additional value into a communication channel they should start using to interact with you.</p><p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s how Backlinko communicates with its website visitors. They tell them that exactly 103,891 people are already enjoying their newsletters which obviously tell us they send great email marketing content. There is also a sentence below the &lsquo;Sing Up&rsquo; button where Brian Dean, Backlinko&rsquo;s owner, lets everyone know he will share his tips that doubled his traffic in two weeks. It&rsquo;s hard not to click on that button when you have so many social proofs on one page.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115127429-1559115127429.png" width="602" height="419" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="katespade">2.7 Kate Spade: Combining simplicity and creativity</h4><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of ways you can craft your messaging and design for your sign up form, but the ones that are simple yet creative usually bring the best results. Having too much text on a page or a form can make a person stop reading and not sign up in the end. However, if you keep it simple, provide one crucial benefit and interact with your audience in a fun, creative way, you will easily gain more subscribers.</p><p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s the strategy Kate Spade uses for their newsletter. They&rsquo;ve provided a simple form with black letters on a white background without any design elements, but their message is definitely not plain or boring. Their messaging is fun and catchy as they mostly communicate with the younger audience and they&rsquo;ve even decided to create a unique call-to-action button which says &lsquo;Get my 15% off&rsquo;. This way, their website visitors know what they will get if they subscribe right away.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115127988-1559115127988.png" width="565" height="393" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="hustlepanda">2.8 Hustle Panda: Specifying the email marketing content</h4><p dir="ltr">If you want your target audience to subscribe to your newsletters, you will need to give them a reason for it. Being transparent about the content you will send to those who subscribe will encourage them to sign up. More importantly, those who sign up will be interested in the content you&rsquo;ll be sending because they know what to expect in your newsletters.</p><p dir="ltr">Hustle Panda immediately lets their audience know what they will get if they subscribe. By providing your name and email, you will receive new domains every few weeks. So, not only do they tell you what content they will send you but also how often.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115128057-1559115128057.png" width="552" height="312" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="bizchix">2.9 BizChix: Focusing on design</h4><p dir="ltr">As we already said, copy and design are the most important elements of email marketing. However, not a lot of businesses focus on design as much as they do on the text. So, if you decide to make your design a bit different than others, be sure it will captivate the attention of your audience.</p><p dir="ltr">BIzChix used a simple form but they&rsquo;ve decided to play with the color contrast to invite people to join their community. With only two fields to fill, their customers get to enjoy a playful form and a simple sing up process. Knowing that simplicity is key, they&rsquo;ve spiced it up with a strong color like yellow and painted their call-to-action button blue.</p><h2 dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115128020-1559115128020.png" width="388" height="289" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></h2><h4 dir="ltr"><br></h4><h4 dir="ltr" id="launchRock">2.10 LaunchRock: Creating minimalistic sign up page</h4><p dir="ltr">Among all the options you have when thinking how to attract more people to sign up to your newsletter e.g. simple popup forms to pages with benefits, social proof and multiple choices, there is one more you need to consider &ndash; minimalistic sign up page. For it, you will need to create a &#39;Sign Up&#39; page on your website or a landing page but provide only essential information. That includes the name of your brand, reasons for signing up, one field, and a call-to-action button. Minimalistic pages are great for converting your visitors into subscribers as they are pretty simple yet intriguing enough to subscribe.</p><p dir="ltr">LaunchRock created an excellent example of such page where they offer one-step sign up for their audience. With a great background, this site provides the visitors with just enough information to join their email list, but also have an additional &#39;Learn More&#39; button for those who wish to read more information about their business.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559115129104-1559115129104.png" width="602" height="453" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><hr><h4 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h4><p dir="ltr">If you still haven&rsquo;t created your sign up strategy that will bring your hundreds of thousands of new email subscribers, you should do it now. Your customers love to be engaged through interesting newsletters from businesses. Ignoring the potential of email marketing could harm your business more than you can imagine. Choose one of our suggested best practices and find a way to adjust it so it fits your brand. Regardless of your choice, if you create a captivating sign up page or form, you will enjoy new subscribers every day.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',

What is a Payment Gateway?</h3><p dir="ltr">To simplify it, a payment gateway is what&rsquo;s between your E-commerce store and the payment processor that receives a payment from the customer. The moment your customer adds his payment details, the payment gateway is responsible for sending that data to the payment processor. According to a<a href="https://www.ellucian.com/assets/en/ebook/ebook-ovum-2018-global-payments-insight-survey.pdf">&nbsp;study from 2018</a>, companies are expected to continue increasing their investments in payment capacities due to rising customer expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">As more companies are moving their stores online to provide their customers with an exceptional digital customer journey, the payment gateway takes care of authorizing payments and ensuring the data provided is sufficient to finalize the payment process. It protects the crucial information from your credit card by encrypting all sensitive data it contains. Thanks to the encryption, personal private details of your customers are passed securely between them and your store.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have an E-commerce store, you should consider one of the numerous payment gateways as choosing the most reliable and secure one will attract more customers and, consequently, more closed deals.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="types">1.1 &nbsp;Types of payment gateways</h4><p dir="ltr">Before you get familiar with the names of the companies which provide a payment gateway for E-commerce businesses, you should understand which type best suits your needs. First, there are modern and classic payment gateways.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="modern">1.2 &nbsp;Modern payment gateway</h4><p dir="ltr">A modern payment gateway doesn&rsquo;t require a merchant account for a business to be able to accept credit card payment, all you need to have is a valid bank account. The most popular modern payment gateway example is PayPal. If you choose PayPal or any of its alternative solutions, you will not have to change bank accounts or do anything additional to integrate it as your payment method. Most of the times, integrating a modern payment gateway is really a quick process. But, you should be aware of its downsides, such as higher fees than classic gateways and sending your customers to off-sites to make a payment.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="classic">1.3 &nbsp;Classic payment gateway</h4><p dir="ltr">With a classic payment gateway, you need to have a merchant account. The most popular one is Authorize.net. When compared to their counterparts, they take longer to set up and require some technical knowledge as it needs to be integrated via API. Those who have chosen a classic payment gateway will need to find a bank that provides merchant accounts and then apply for it. Unfortunately, merchant accounts are not provided by all banks and sometimes the approval and setup time can take up to 6 weeks. The main benefit of these gateways is lower fees per transactions when compared to modern ones.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="hosted">1.4 &nbsp;Hosted and integrated gateways</h4><p dir="ltr">Also, you should know you can choose between hosted and integrated gateways. The difference between them is the place where the payment gateway takes place i.e. integrated into your store or hosted off-site. If you choose hosted payment gateways, your customers will be redirected to the payment processor&rsquo;s platform each time they want to make a purchase to insert the required details.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, with integrated payment gateways, you&rsquo;re connecting it to your E-commerce store via the gateway&rsquo;s provided API. Similar to a comparison of modern and classic solutions, these two also have their advantages and disadvantages. The choice should be made based on your business needs and your customers&rsquo; habits and preferences.</p><hr><h3 dir="ltr" id="top5">2.

This will make your setup process a bit complex and maybe not as user-friendly as you want your E-commerce store to be.

    html: '<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s easy to understand how to close a sale but to actually close a deal after the initial meeting is more difficult than most of us think. You can be prepared as much as you want, give your perfectly crafted pitch and solve all of your prospects issues, but you still might not close the deal in the end. Sometimes, due to various reasons, your prospects will not be able or interested enough to purchase what you have to offer.</p><p dir="ltr">You have probably read a lot of variations of success formulas for closing the sales and when testing them, you didn&rsquo;t see any results from them. However, there are a few closing techniques that work, but we have to warn you they won&rsquo;t be successful for every business. You will have to first understand them to know when to utilize them.</p><p dir="ltr">Did you know that more than<a href="https://blog.close.com/39-shocking-stats-that-will-change-the-way-you-sell">&nbsp;90% of salespeople will give up on a prospect</a> after being rejected four times, but prospects will most likely say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to you after they refuse your offer four times? So, the first thing you should know about closing the sale is not to give up because your prospects expect you to try a bit harder if you wish to win them over. Embrace the game and be persistent!</p><p dir="ltr">To ensure your effort is impeccable and all of your prospects become your future customers, we bring you seven closing techniques and explain why they work. Start reading and make sure you implement them to enjoy great sales results and customer relationships.</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">Table of contents</h6><ol><li><a href="#assumptiveClose">Assumptive Close: Closing with Confidence and Positivity</a></li><li><a href="#nowOrNever">&lsquo;Now or Never&rsquo; Close: Creating A Sense of Urgency</a></li><li><a href="#Hard">Hard Close: Your Last Move in This Game</a></li><li><a href="#takeaway">Takeaway Close: Taking Them Off The Table</a></li><li><a href="#option">Option Close: Providing Options to Encourage Making a Decision</a></li><li><a href="#backwards">Backwards Close: Starting At The End of Customer Journey</a></li><li><a href="#question">Question Close: Find Out What They Are Thinking About</a></li></ol><hr><h3 dir="ltr" id="assumptiveClose">1. Assumptive Close: Closing with Confidence and Positivity </h3><p dir="ltr">This tactic is based on the idea that you strongly believe you will close this deal and make a sale from the second you put effort into it. The way you communicate with your prospects is like you&rsquo;re already assuming that this is a closed deal which only lacks a few details and that&rsquo;s it. What makes this tactic successful is actively checking on your prospects, estimating their level of interest, talking about their doubts and realizing whether you&rsquo;re both on the same page. If not, you will quickly find a way to solve it so your prospects can be sure that your product or service is the right choice for them.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559536548399-1559536548399.png" width="602" height="315" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr">After all, if you&rsquo;re great at recognizing the needs of your prospects, they will believe that what you offer can truly be beneficial for them. With an assumptive close, your positive attitude and confidence are so contagious that your prospects will believe everything you say. However, this tactic shouldn&rsquo;t be used with your new leads as it will not be as efficient as when you use it with familiar leads who already know a thing or two about your business.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="nowOrNever">2. &lsquo;Now or Never&rsquo; Close: Creating A Sense of Urgency</h3><p dir="ltr">With a &lsquo;Now or Never&rsquo; close, you&rsquo;re offering your prospects something they can only get to enjoy if they commit in a few days or any other limitation period. This closing tactic is usually used when a business promotes the last product they have remaining, a certain discount is provided if prospect commits today or offering a special price for a limited period of time. The &lsquo;Now or Never&rsquo; approach is very efficient with your prospects because they will feel they are losing something and decide to commit right away not to lose this opportunity.</p><p dir="ltr">When communicated this way, your offer sounds so appealing that rejecting it wouldn&rsquo;t be a good choice for a prospect. If your prospects are the type of people who want the best for themselves under best conditions, this is the tactic you should be utilizing. Of course, to offer them a discount, you need to have that level of freedom provided by your superiors, so always ensure that you&rsquo;re not promising something you can&rsquo;t deliver.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="hard">3. Hard Close: Your Last Move in This Game</h3><p dir="ltr">Hard close is often referred to as &#39;Nothing to Lose&#39; close and it implies that you will be very straightforward with your selling. Your prospects will be aware that your goal is to sell this product as you will ask them for firm commitments and make sure they&#39;re proceeding to the next stage. You will probably ask questions like when they will be able to sign the contract or when can you set up the implementation to get them to commit right away.</p><p dir="ltr">Remember that information about the number of times your prospect will say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to you until they decide to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;? Here is where a hard close comes in. Your prospects are already familiar with your products or services and they just need a little bit of encouragement to make a purchase. However, don&rsquo;t use this tactic if you think it&rsquo;s not the right timing. The hard close is usually used by salespeople when they know they&rsquo;ve run out of other options and there is really nothing to lose.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="takeaway">4. Takeaway Close: Taking Them Off The Table</h3><p dir="ltr">The takeaway close is very different from all the above-mentioned tactics but could be implemented after the hard close. Salespeople will decide to use this approach when they&rsquo;ve already explained all the benefits to their prospects, but they don&rsquo;t seem as interested as you want them to be. That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s time to take them off the table. However, you should first offer them cost savings that could be achieved in certain ways. If you do so, maybe they will accept your offer in the end. You already know that the price is one of the determining factors for the majority of your customers, so if you&rsquo;re able to redefine the price by removing elements or features they don&rsquo;t need, both sides can win.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="option">5. Option Close: Providing Options to Encourage Making a Decision</h3><p dir="ltr">Option close is a tactic that is similar to the hard or assumptive close. Your prospects will be offered with a choice between two or even more options to encourage them to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to one of these options instead of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; due to uncertainty. That can be anything - two or more similar products, two or more pricing plans for your solution or anything else that would satisfy their needs.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559536549000-1559536549000.png" width="602" height="401" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr">This is a good approach to use if you see that your prospect is interested but uncertain about what to choose. When you tell them which options would be great for them, they will be more likely choose one of them. Keep in mind that option close is great for leads who are already familiar with your products but still haven&#39;t made up their mind for some reason.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="backwards">6. Backwards Close: Starting At The End of Customer Journey</h3><p dir="ltr">This sales tactic is something that&rsquo;s completely reversing the sales cycle training, but it can be really successful with some of your leads. As the name suggests, the backwards close implies that you should start at the end by asking your leads for referrals instead of selling them your products. When your prospects realize you&rsquo;re not trying to sell them anything, they will feel more relaxed to continue the interaction with you and be more open to listening to you.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, the backwards close may not be the right tactic for your new prospects as it makes no sense to jump into the conversation with such an unusual idea. You may find better success with this strategy on warmer leads who would already have a better understanding of your business. When you know the prospect and believe he is not interested to purchase the product, you should definitely give this approach a try.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="question">7. Question Close: Find Out What They Are Thinking About</h3><p dir="ltr">With the question close, you will ask your prospect to provide you with more information from their side. By asking your prospect questions, they will explain to you what is holding them back from committing. It can be anything from inconvenient timing to features that are confusing your prospects. When they provide you with their explanation, you will be able to understand their perspective better. More importantly, you will be able to modify the interaction so you&rsquo;re able to successfully solve the issues your prospect addresses and, hopefully, close the deal.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559536548194-1559536548194.png" width="602" height="339" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr">When asking questions, you will hear much more than just the reason for not committing right away. From the way they answer, you will notice if they are interested in your products and what is the weak point of your product for that particular prospect. When you notice your prospect is still around but hasn&#39;t explained what is holding them back, the question close tactic should definitely be utilized.</p><h3 dir="ltr">What is the best tactic for your prospects? </h3><p dir="ltr">With these seven closing tactics, you will be able to engage different types of prospects with greater confidence. After all, every sales deal is different, so the interaction with each prospect should be as personalized as possible. These approaches allow you to focus on a particular prospect and provide with exactly what he needs at each stage. Once you understand your prospect&#39;s perspective better, you will be able to deliver better sales results. Remember that buyers ultimately buy from people they trust, and in sales, trust starts from understanding.</p>',

But, your product or service is not made to satisfy the needs of every person on the planet. Instead, focus on those who could truly be interested in what you have to offer. Wasting your time trying to attract people who won&rsquo;t even consider purchasing your products or services will take your time and money away from the possibilities that could truly be beneficial for your business.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when you&rsquo;ve determined what your niche market is, you will need to optimize your website for people with different motives and interests. After all, not all visitors who come to your website will be there for the same reason. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital that your website has numerous ways that could engage them, encourage them to interact with your brand and finally, interest them in making a purchase.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When trying to target the audience, try to be as specific as possible. Ask yourself various questions that will help you determine to what type of audience are you sending your messages. These are some of the questions that can help you:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Is your customer a male or female?&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr">What would be the age of your youngest and oldest customer?</li><li dir="ltr">What is the average income of your customer?</li><li dir="ltr">On what will your customer spend his/her money?</li><li dir="ltr">What would be the communication style of your customer?&nbsp;</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you start answering these questions, it will be much easier to imagine your customer persona. Write everything down and start analysing the answers. Without this, it will be really difficult to make the most of any of the below-mentioned lead generation tactics through your website.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="webConverts">Website that Converts Your Visitors&nbsp;</h3><p dir="ltr">Obviously, your website needs to convert, but what does that actually mean? Well, on your website, you should have pages that are created with the goal to convert the visitors. Don&rsquo;t start working on your web design until you&rsquo;ve determined which pages have the best possibility to convert.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561006556522-1561006556522.png" width="600" height="414" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"></p><p dir="ltr">As the majority of businesses is focused on creating professional websites with exquisite design and interactive elements, they tend to forget about the conversion elements. Your website can be truly outstanding when it comes to design, but if there is nothing that converts your visitors, it will fail to bring you profit. Start testing all the elements of your website, from text, images and videos to overall design, to see which of them converts the best. Determining this in the first phase will ensure you&rsquo;re making smart investments from the start.</p><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re unsure of how to turn one of the pages on your website into a conversion opportunity, you can always create a landing page that&rsquo;s created just to convert your visitors. However, be careful as messaging needs to be really powerful and effective on such websites.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="directIntention">Be Direct with Your Intentions</h3><p dir="ltr">If you want to successfully convert your visitors, you will need to let them know you&rsquo;re trying to do so. When you&rsquo;re publishing information about your business, products or services, make sure you&rsquo;re doing it in a way it builds trust in your business. After all, your visitors will not become your prospects or customers if they don&rsquo;t trust you. They will simply leave the website and never return again.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">To avoid this, you need to be very careful with the content you publish on your website. Start by publishing your contact phone numbers where your potential customers can learn more about your business and get the information they need to make a purchase. A converting page should also have a compelling sales headline that makes it very clear what this product or service is about.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, focus on creating a high-resolution image that will resonate with your customers&rsquo; current experience and encourage them to spend more time on your website. The copy you choose to publish should also be very sales-oriented so the visitors are compelled to take action on the website. Don&rsquo;t forget to include call-to-action messages to let your visitors know what actions they should take to get the desired outcome.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="generateLeads">Ways to Generate Leads from Your Website</h3><p dir="ltr">Now that you&#39;ve built or re-built your website so it suits the needs and desires of your target audience, it&#39;s time to start generating leads. Your website is a powerful platform that can bring you numerous benefits if you know how to utilize it the right way.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Below, we bring you some of the most successful ways of generating leads through your website, so make sure you start testing them as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="database">1. Database Network</h4><p dir="ltr">If you want to get qualified leads, you should invite people to register on your database network. You can achieve that by inviting them to subscribe to your website&rsquo;s email list or even by following you on social media platforms. By becoming a part of your community, whether it&rsquo;s through email or social media, your prospects will stay close to your brand and you can start building the trust essential for converting them into customers.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="popups">2. Pop-ups</h4><p dir="ltr">To be converted, your website visitors will need a trigger, something that will make them take that action you need them to. A great way to trigger visitors to take action is with pop-ups on your website. You can create them for any purpose you think would be of value to your business, from subscribing to your weekly newsletter to getting your latest guide or eBook. This way, you will gather a significant number of email addresses to continue the communication with these prospects and engage them on a more meaningful level.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561006556574-1561006556574.png" width="558" height="286" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="retargeting">3. Retargeting Tags</h4><p dir="ltr">You can also implement retargeting tags which allow you to promote your website content, products or services across various ad networks. It&rsquo;s simpler and more cost-effective to retarget someone who has already been on your website than trying to promote it to someone who has never heard of your business. Just add the retargeting code to your website and start targeting your previous website visitors so they can return to the website.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="customer">4. Customer Testimonials and Reviews</h4><p dir="ltr">Your website should definitely have customer testimonials or reviews as it&rsquo;s one of the most powerful ways to convert a visitor into a prospect. When a person sees your product is being praised by other people and they realize how good your product actually is, they will be encouraged to make the next step. Place your testimonials or reviews somewhere where all visitors can easily find them. Also, consider publishing them in a form of video as it&rsquo;s considered the most engaging type of content and it also helps you with search engine rankings.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="callTracking">5. Call Tracking</h4><p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;re probably using several traffic sources to generate phone calls, so why not send each source to a dedicated landing page that also includes a unique phone number? Once your potential customers land on your landing page, it will be much easier to convert them. Generating leads is much easier if you can combine different channels and use them to achieve the same goal. Make sure your landing pages are well structured and straight to the point.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="googleAnalytics">6. Google Analytics Data</h4><p dir="ltr">Trying to generate leads without analysing your traffic will be extremely difficult and, most of the times, unsuccessful. If you start utilizing Google Analytics, this free tool will provide you with valuable insights such as why some traffic sources aren&rsquo;t producing conversions and what are your visitors doing before the converting moment. With this type of information, you can allocate your budget to where it will bring you the best results, whether it&rsquo;s social media, email or something completely different. Of course, you can purchase other tracking tools that will provide you with more details on your website traffic, but you shoul start with Google Analytics to learn basics.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="liveChat">7. Live Chat</h4><p dir="ltr">Many businesses wrongfully assume that live chat is only reserved for websites that are focused on generating e-commerce sales. Of course, providing answers your customers need in order to make a purchase will surely contribute to your sales results, but live chat can also generate a lot of leads to a business. With live chat, you can give your potential customers the information that will raise their interest in your business. It can be anything from clarifying how to utilize your product or how simple is the instalment of your software.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561006556633-1561006556633.png" width="602" height="333" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"></p><hr><h3 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h3><p dir="ltr">To generate leads from your website, it needs to be well optimized and prepared for conversion. Every single detail on your website can help you in converting your website visitors into prospects. Before you start crafting your lead generation strategy that&rsquo;s focused mostly on your website, ensure you&rsquo;ve covered all the elements, including content and design, and then start implementing these tactics.&nbsp;</p>',

    html: '<p dir="ltr">There are plenty of ways a website can make money, from affiliate marketing to e-commerce. One of these numerous ways to monetize your website is to build a listing platform. Also known as a directory site, this platform lists and links to other websites and businesses in only one or a few niches.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to monetize your listing platform and generate a certain income, you&rsquo;ll be happy to hear there are numerous ways to achieve it. However, setting up a listing platform is not easy as it takes a lot of time and hard work. Once it&rsquo;s ready, you will be able to try out these numerous revenue streams that could bring you a lot of money.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In this article, we will take a closer look at the top 10 ways how listing platforms make money with useful tips on how you can do the same.&nbsp;</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">Table of contents</h6><ol><li dir="ltr"><a href="#chargingList">Charging of list</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#claimListing">Letting businesses claim their own listings</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#sellingAdvSpace">Selling Advertising Space</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#privateListing">Making some listings private</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#createMemberships">Create memberships</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#platformForSelling">Having a platform for selling services and products</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#focusOnMarketing">Focusing on marketing</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#contentMarketingStrategy">Building a content marketing strategy</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#utilizingPPC">Utilizing PPC for your listing platform</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="#createExtraServices">Create extra services</a></li></ol><hr><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563960420797-1563960420797.png" width="480" height="330" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="chargingList">1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Charging for Listings</h3><p dir="ltr">Of course, the most obvious way to make money from your listing platform is to charge for listings. As we already said, your listing niche can be anything from restaurants and hotels to software solutions and financial services. You can charge companies just to place their listing on your platform or they can even upgrade to a premium listing that will show additional information in return.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Providing Different Types of Listings on Your Platform&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">These premium listings can differ in price, depending on what you decide to offer. For instance, your most expensive listings can consist of additional features such as images, social media links, additional text space, etc. Most of the times, premium listings are placed on the top of your page ensuring every visitor sees it immediately as he enters your platform.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to sell your listings, that can help you create recurring revenue as well. You can have monthly fees where the listing will be displayed until the last paid day. Keep in mind that if you&rsquo;re trying to charge for listings, you will need to demonstrate these businesses your listing platform is receiving adequate traffic to encourage them to pay for it.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="claimListing">2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Letting Businesses Claim Their Own Listings&nbsp;</h3><p dir="ltr">If you wish to keep your listing platform relevant and updated while you&rsquo;re also generating profit, you should consider encouraging businesses to claim their own listings. This way, you will not have to hard-sell them. Your focus is that your platform displays the correct information.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Additional Options - Photos, Links, Text, Opening Hours</h4><p dir="ltr">Businesses can turn to Google Business and Yelp to successfully claim their listings. Then, companies can claim or purchase these listings. Claiming their listing implies these businesses can enjoy the option of adding more photos, contact links, text, reply to reviews, update of their important information such as opening hours, etc.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Also, companies can use these listings to promote their brand. But how can a listing platform owner benefit from that? Well, you can easily generate traffic and display the correct information about all of these businesses without having an aggressive sales approach.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="sellingAdvSpace">3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Selling Advertising Space</h3><p dir="ltr">When thinking about ways how listing platforms make money, you will notice that many of them choose not to charge for the listings or even for claiming them. The reason for that is that having all of these companies listed is very crucial for you if you wish to have a successful listing platform and provide accurate and valuable information to your audience.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Connecting Your Ads to Specific Content on Your Platform</h4><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, charging for listings might result in a platform that&rsquo;s not displaying accurate information about these businesses. If that happens, you will lose your visitors and unfortunately, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to get them back once they leave. That&rsquo;s why many listing platforms owners will choose to sell their advertising space as a way to earn money.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can place the advertisements on your page or your posts. You can even connect your ads with specific content so your audience can benefit in more than one way. They can be charged as a recurring fee which means you will have a regular income from it. This also requires you have a proof of your website traffic to encourage a business to pay for an advertisement on your listing platform.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563960421827-1563960421827.png" width="602" height="425" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="privateListing">4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Making Some Listings Private</h3><p dir="ltr">Listing platforms can also make money by charging their visitors to view the content they have on their platform. If you decide to make some of your listings private, you can charge your audience the access to these listings.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Hiding Listing With Plugins&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">There are even plugins you can get that will help you hide listings you want until a user has paid to access them. You can choose whether you&rsquo;ll charge it as a one-off payment or as a recurring subscription. Once your users have paid, they can view all of your private listings.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you choose this method, make sure your hiding listings are truly worth the money someone is going to pay for them. Think about the type of listings your audience would be willing to pay and start crafting your strategy.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="createMemberships">5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Create Memberships</h3><p dir="ltr">If you set up a listing platform that provides a membership of various types, you can also generate recurring revenue. Your users will have to sign up and pay a certain fee to access your platform and see the information you have on it. Most of the times, listing platforms will charge this fee once a month, but it can also be a one-off fee.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Determining What Information is Worth Paying For</h4><p dir="ltr">If you wish to create a successful membership strategy on your listing platform, you will first need to ensure that your platform is full of useful, valuable content that somebody will gladly pay for. What type of information would users in your niche pay for just to have access to them?&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Besides listing, you should also think about creating your own blog which will have videos, podcasts, industry overview and trends, infographics, webinars, live events, member forums, etc. If you update your platform with high-quality content very often, people will be more willing to become members. After all, that&rsquo;s how listing platforms make money nowadays.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563960425294-1563960425294.png" width="602" height="332" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="platformForSelling">6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Have A Platform for Selling Services and Products</h3><p dir="ltr">You can also decide to monetize your listing platform if you turn it into a page that is actually allowing businesses to sell their services and products. The most known example of such a platform is AirBnB.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Benefits for Businesses that Sell their Services and Products</h4><p dir="ltr">Depending on the niche&rsquo;s nature, you can determine how you will shape the platform so these businesses can also make the most of it. This will help you keep traffic on your platform and encourage your recurring visitors to come back.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, your users will need to see certain benefits from selling their services and products on your platform. Providing them only with an online place to do it is not enough, once again, you will need to have all the numbers.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="focusOnMarketing">7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Focusing on Marketing</h3><p dir="ltr">Your listing platform is an excellent source for the marketing of these businesses. For instance, you can lend them your visitor database and they can use it for the upcoming marketing campaign. You can help companies send promotion news, advertise their campaigns and so much more just by charging for the information you already have about your visitors. This way, these listings will not only be promoted on your platform but also to their email address.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Providing Your Audience With Additional Content</h4><p dir="ltr">If your platform has a big visitor database, this method will make you more money than any other. When you&rsquo;re marketing your customer information, you are also ensuring your customers are getting more valuable information which helps you build a good reputation for your listing platform. Gradually, you will notice an increase in your traffic numbers and, of course, a bigger revenue.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="contentMarketingStrategy">8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Building a Content Marketing Strategy</h3><p dir="ltr">We&rsquo;ve already mentioned running a blog as an additional feature to provide to your users who are willing to pay for the content you have on your listing platform, but you should also consider creating an entire content marketing strategy for this as well.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Writing Guides and Connecting Articles to Your Listings</h4><p dir="ltr">Most of the times, these listing platforms have so little content and having a place where you will provide something of value should be one of your main focuses. You can use that blog for internal linking and connect it to your listing categories to help visitors find the information they need.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can write guides on your blog or even run a monthly showcase where you&rsquo;ll feature a particular business. Companies will enjoy that type of exposure where you&rsquo;re mentioning their name and talking in more detail about their business. You can easily charge for interviews or case studies on your blog but you will need to have very high traffic numbers as well.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563960421903-1563960421903.png" width="602" height="349" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="utilizingPPC">9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Utilizing PPC for Your Listing Platform</h3><p dir="ltr">PPC is an abbreviation that stands for pay-per-click advertising. If you&rsquo;re wondering how listing platforms make money from PPC, it can be utilized to get people to list and to get traffic. The choice will depend on your goals but you can also combine these two to get a better result. If you&rsquo;re just launching your platform, you will want to invest your money in PPC to get the traffic as you need it to fulfil your objectives.</p><h4 dir="ltr">The Risk of Investing in PPC Campaigns</h4><p dir="ltr">Then, as time goes by, you can advertise it in order to get more listings on your platform. If you&rsquo;re already an established platform, you can choose to go with both or choose the one that has more sense for your platform at the moment. You have to be aware that PPC is riskier than all the other methods, but if done right, you can gather a significant amount of money from the traffic your PPC campaign gained.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="createExtraServices">10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Create Extra Services</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you&rsquo;ve established your listing platform and you are recognized within your niche, you can create extra services for all of these businesses and sell it to them. For instance, if you&rsquo;re listings are for real estate businesses, you can sell your guide on how to close deals more faster with suggestions from industry leaders all over the world. It can really be anything as long as you can provide an expert perspective on the topic and your audience is willing to pay for it.</p><hr><h3 dir="ltr">Final Thoughts</h3><p dir="ltr">Today, listing platforms make money from different sources and there&rsquo;s no reason for you to neglect the profit you could earn from it. Of course, it&rsquo;s up to you to choose among these ways to make money from your listing platform. Your decision should be made based on the maturity of your platform, the size of your audience and the nature of the niche. Whatever you do, make sure you&rsquo;re providing quality to your visitors as that&rsquo;s the only thing that will make them come back again and again!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',

Creating a Buyer Persona</h3><p dir="ltr">The first thing that needs to be done before crafting your next sales or marketing strategy is creating a buyer persona. By creating a buyer persona, you will have a deeper understanding of your potential customers and how you can interest them enough to make their purchase.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="elementForBusiness">Buyer Persona Elements For Every Business</h4><p dir="ltr">The elements that will help you create your ideal buyer are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Gender</li><li dir="ltr">Age</li><li dir="ltr">Location</li><li dir="ltr">Profession&nbsp;</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Depending on your business, you can add more elements. For instance, if your company is selling athlete shoes, you can include elements that will help you understand your target audience much better such as hobbies, events they visit, etc. The goal of creating buyer personas is to identify customer groups and what makes them different from each other. This will tremendously help you with your sales and marketing efforts.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563964789195-1563964789195.png" width="602" height="339" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="drivingTraffic">2. Driving Traffic</h3><p dir="ltr">First, we need to point out that having traffic on your website is truly terrific, but without the right type of traffic, you will not be able to grow online sales. If you&rsquo;re just boosting your traffic with random people, you need to be aware that the majority of these people is not interested in purchasing your product. In other words, you can have 10,000 visits per day and not even one closed sale.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="targetingRight">Targeting the Right People and Communicating the Right Way</h4><p dir="ltr">To avoid this from happening, you will need to focus on driving relevant traffic. In other words, you will need to target the right people and communicate the right messages to them. A key part of high conversion is assuring your company has relevant traffic. Don&rsquo;t waste your money on ads that target everyone near your area, regardless of your niche.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The better you become with targeting, the better your online sales results will be. Direct your money on audiences that are interested in your products or services and you will see many benefits from it. Determine why people need your product, create your message and start communicating it only to those people who are interested in purchasing.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="captivatingDesign">3. Captivating Website Design</h3><p dir="ltr">Having a beautifully designed website will tremendously help you in attracting traffic. It will also interest people enough to stay on your website, go through different pages and find something they might like. Design is essential when it comes to growing online sales.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="looksAndWorks">How Your Website Looks Like and How Your Website Works</h4><p dir="ltr">Take a look at the websites of some of the most popular online businesses. They all have a captivating and interactive design that makes you want to stay longer on these sites and explore them!&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When talking about design, it&rsquo;s important to note that it doesn&rsquo;t only imply how the website looks but also how it works. Try to use your own photos and find a good web designer who will help you convey your key messages through a captivating design. If you&rsquo;re not a designer yourself, it definitely means you have to hire someone.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="valuePropositions">4. Value Propositions</h3><p dir="ltr">What is the value you&rsquo;re promising to deliver to your target audience? What is the main reason your website visitor should purchase from you and not your competitor? Value propositions will explain what particular problem your product or service solves and how it improves their situation. Also, it will reveal certain benefits of your product or service. Lastly, it will let your prospects know why you&rsquo;re the best choice for them.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="crucial">Value Propositions are Crucial for Landing Pages</h4><p dir="ltr">This should be very clearly displayed on your website, whether it&rsquo;s on the homepage, &lsquo;Products/Services&rsquo; page or any other place that you know your visitors will check once they land on your website. Value propositions are especially vital when you&rsquo;re creating landing pages. As they are created to convert your visitors, you will need to build the entire page around value propositions. Otherwise, you will lose sales.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563964789398-1563964789398.png" width="602" height="452" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="determine">How to Determine Your Value Proposition</h4><p dir="ltr">These are questions might help you determine your value proposition and show it to your target audience, no matter what is the niche of your business:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">What is it that you&rsquo;re offering to your target audience?</li><li dir="ltr">What is the benefit of that product or service?&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr">Who is your product or service created for?&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="tracking">5. Tracking Buying Phases</h3><p dir="ltr">Online sales is not just a one-step thing. The majority of the people who will visit your website for the first time will not purchase the product right away. You will need to have something that will encourage them to start thinking about buying. That something needs to be of value to them, from discount coupons if they order immediately to referral link with benefits for their friends.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="diffStages">Determining Different Stages of the Customer Journey</h4><p dir="ltr">Anything that could motivate someone to return to your website can significantly help you to grow online sales. Don&rsquo;t expect your prospects to make a purchase if they don&rsquo;t recognize the reasons for it on your website. You will need to understand first how people approach online shopping to be able to close the sale.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You need to see which stages your potential buyer can be in and create a strategy for each of them. How can you motivate a person who is just checking your website to return? How can you encourage your prospect who is already well aware of your product to make a purchase? You should communicate differently with each of these groups of customers and to do that successfully, you will need to see what works for each group. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563964788962-1563964788962.png" width="602" height="452" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="reduceAgitation">6. Reduce Agitation</h3><p dir="ltr">Agitation can happen any time you ask your website visitors to commit to something. Of course, you won&rsquo;t be able to completely eliminate that, but you can significantly reduce it. Start paying attention to how your prospects and customers behave on your website and take notes each time you implement something new and different.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="potentialCustomer">Doubts, Second Thoughts and Hesitation of Your Potential Customer</h4><p dir="ltr">When we talk about agitation, we&rsquo;re also talking about the doubts, second thoughts and hesitation your potential customer has when it comes to giving you money for your product or service. &nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If you truly want to reduce agitation and turn a not-convinced prospect into a believer, you will need to address all possible doubts this person might have. The right way to do it is to provide them with complete information. Where there is even the slightest chance of being misunderstood, enhance it and make it clearer and simpler.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="reasons">Reasons for Agitation When Going Through Company&rsquo;s Website</h4><p dir="ltr">Here are some of the things that could lead to your website visitors feeling agitated:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Complicated or long processes</li><li dir="ltr">Asking for too much information from your website visitors</li><li dir="ltr">Not being able to find what you need</li><li dir="ltr">Websites with no contact information &ndash; physical address, email address, phone number, etc.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="socialProof">7. Social Proof</h3><p dir="ltr">One of the most efficient ways to grow online sales is with publishing social proof on your website. Customer testimonials and reviews tremendously increase trustworthiness and encourage your potential buyers to make their first purchase. Your prospects might hesitate when it comes to purchasing because they don&rsquo;t know if they can trust you. More importantly, they have zero evidence of your product quality.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="publishTestimonialAndReviews">Publish Testimonials and Reviews on Your Website To Build Trust</h4><p dir="ltr">By publishing testimonials and reviews on your website, you&rsquo;re not only converting prospects into customers but you&rsquo;re also establishing yourself as a respected brand. Depending on the layout of your website, implement social proof where it fits. You can have an entire page dedicated to customer reviews and testimonials organized by different industries or you can place on the top of your homepage to engage visitors the same second they enter your website.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">With social proof, you can truly achieve a lot without investing too much money or effort into displaying it. There are numerous ways you can engage your prospects and customers with it:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Offer an incentive to people who send you their video testimonial.</li><li dir="ltr">Provide a discount for every person who recommended your products to their friends and contacts.</li><li dir="ltr">Share your reviews and testimonials on your social media accounts.</li><li dir="ltr">Invite the customers who reviewed you to participate in a video testimonial.</li><li dir="ltr">Open a profile on third-party review sites and start interacting with your target audience.&nbsp;</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com.sg/froala-uploads%2F1563964789034-1563964789034.png" width="602" height="685" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><hr><h3 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h3><p dir="ltr">You will need to create a strategy if you wish to grow your online sales. As there are numerous things you will need to keep in mind, it&rsquo;s very easy to forget something or ignore a crucial part that could determine the outcome of your online sales strategy. Attracting and encouraging people to make their purchase decision is your goal but without testing all these various tactics, it will be impossible to achieve it.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Start testing them to determine what works for your business. The sooner you find out what works for your target audience, the sooner you will be able to enhance your online sales results. Make sure that these elements are a part of your strategy because they are essential for your success.&nbsp;</p>',

This is also one of the most common ways to place customer reviews onto your site.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976178-1559120976178.png" width="602" height="237" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"></p><h3 dir="ltr">2. Adding customer testimonials: Highrise</h3><p dir="ltr">Reviews are fantastic and effective if your potential customer is already somewhat certain of its purchase and just needs a confirmation that buying this product is a good idea. For prospects who need more reassuring, customer testimonials are your tool for successful optimization and, of course, conversion. A customer testimonial is more personal than a review as you can include a photo, quote, and other relevant information from your satisfied customer. At Highrise, a company that provides CRM software, they used a customer testimonial to demonstrate all the benefits of their solution for their target audience.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976689-1559120976689.png" width="530" height="379" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="improvingNavigation">3. Improving navigation: ASOS</h3><p dir="ltr">Once your potential customers enter your website, it should be very simple and quick for them to find what they want. Start by deciding on the number of your product categories as too many of them might confuse the visitors and make them stop their search. See if some of your products can be a part of a bigger category so your prospects can find it with just one or two clicks. Keep in mind that your menu items are one of the most determining factors for purchase. Asos, a well-known fashion brand, decided to have two main categories (women and men) and several subcategories for each of them to simplify it for their website visitors.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120977167-1559120977167.png" width="602" height="312" class="fr-fic fr-dii">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">4. Focusing on the product: Trunkster</h3><p dir="ltr">Of course, your E-commerce brand doesn&rsquo;t have to sell hundreds of different products. There are plenty of online stores focused only on a small niche. You can create a special website just for one product and display all the features and benefits to encourage more prospects to purchase it. In the end, what&rsquo;s more powerful than a product photo and its strengths described next to it? That&rsquo;s exactly why Trunkster decided to create a separate page for one of their suitcase models and they even included a call-to-action button with a text &lsquo;Buy Now&rsquo; to make the purchasing process as simple as possible.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976511-1559120976511.png" width="492" height="224" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="userGeneratedContent">5. Publish user-generated content: Vanity Planet</h3><p dir="ltr">You can also increase your conversion rates by adding user-generated content on your E-commerce website. Adding content from one of the social media platforms can be an excellent way to attract more customers. Not only that this tactic shows all the purposes of your product, but it also confirms its quality and, consequently, increases your brand awareness. Vanity Planet added it to their product pages so naturally to ensure the prospect is not overwhelmed with information.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976094-1559120976094.png" width="514" height="285" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="complementaryProducts">6. Including complementary products: Ikea</h3><p dir="ltr">If your website visitors are looking for a certain product, why not recommend them a complementary one which will provide them with an even better experience? This method works with both B2B and B2C E-commerce brands as every business can guide their customers to an expanded customer journey, after the first purchase has been made. It can be an upgrade to a better pricing plan that unlocks more features for the purchase software solution or a jacket that goes great with the purchased jeans. IKEA, a famous Swedish brand, recommends their prospects what else they should consider buying if they are looking, for instance, for an outdoor table.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976342-1559120976342.png" width="602" height="227" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976558-1559120976557.png" width="602" height="257" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="customerBehaviourInfo">7. Including customer behaviour information: Walmart</h3><p dir="ltr">As an E-commerce brand, you have one valuable advantage that your counterpart, a physical store, doesn&#39;t have &ndash; insights. With website analytics, you can get impeccable details about your customer&#39;s behaviour that can help you optimize your store better. One of the ways you could use it is to reveal to your potential customers what others who&#39;ve searched for the same product also checked in your store. That way, you can provide them with alternative solutions if this particular product didn&#39;t meet their needs. Walmart uses this method with its website visitors where they display these products in a section called &#39;Customers also considered&#39;.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120976941-1559120976941.png" width="602" height="200" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="urgency">8. Creating a sense of urgency: The Musicians Guide</h3><p dir="ltr">If you really want to encourage your prospects to act right away, you should consider creating a sense of urgency. You can easily do it with a limited time offer of your products. In other words, offer prospects discounts for particular products or even for your entire store. Some E-commerce brands create this type of offers during special occasions such as holidays or anniversaries, but you can actually do it anytime you want. The Musician Guide created a sense of urgency which was highlighted with a countdown timer on the top of their page and a strong call to action below to make their potential customers act fast. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120977528-1559120977528.png" width="602" height="260" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="videoContent">9. Adding video content: Tassimo Shop</h3><p dir="ltr">We all know how powerful video is when compared to other types of content. However, using it to promote your products will bring you even more benefits than you&#39;re aware of. As your prospects don&#39;t have the opportunity to touch, feel and see the product for themselves, video is the only thing that comes close to the experience your prospects would have in the actual store. Tassimo Shop decided to add video content on their product pages where they&#39;re demonstrating how to use a particular product. After all, an educative and informative content has a highly engaging and conversion rate and will definitely bring you more closed deals.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120978228-1559120978228.png" width="533" height="358" class="fr-fic fr-dii">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="mobileSearch">10. Incorporating visual mobile search: Boohoo</h3><p dir="ltr">We can&#39;t ignore the influence social media has in today&#39;s world and it definitely strongly impacts customers&#39; decisions about certain products, especially with young customers. Now, customers want to shop a product they&#39;ve seen, for instance on Instagram, right away. However, it doesn&#39;t just stop with social media as customers want to purchase clothing items they see on people in the street. To create a solution for such demand, Boohoo decided to implement a visual mobile search where their website visitors can upload an image to find the most similar products on their site.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120977599-1559120977599.png" width="602" height="439" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="mobileFirst">11. Optimizing for a mobile-first experience: Merchology</h3><p dir="ltr">Not only the entire customer journey changed under the influence of technology and social media, but also the way customers shop for products. People now use mobile phones far more than they use laptops and computers. Consequently, the customers have started to purchase products via their smartphones as well. Not optimizing your E-commerce website for a mobile-first experience could cost you a significant amount of customers. An excellent example of a mobile-first online experience is by a company called Merchology which provided their visitors with an impeccable mobile-first experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120977232-1559120977232.png" width="310" height="555" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="automaingSales">12. Automating sales: Evy&rsquo;s Tree</h3><p dir="ltr">Automating sales is still one of the most efficient ways to take your sales to the next level. By automating promotions on your website, you can save a lot of time and money but also increase your conversion and retention rates.

This way, they&rsquo;ve simplified the process for their customers and earned their loyalty by being transparent.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120977410-1559120977410.png" width="602" height="212" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="connectingStore">13.

Focusing on blog content: Etsy</h3><p dir="ltr">Talking about the optimization of your E-commerce website would be pointless if we don&rsquo;t mention content.

Start writing blog articles about your products where you provide your customers and prospects with useful information that might help them utilize the purchased product better. Etsy, a global E-commerce brand, is strongly focused on their content strategy as a way of attracting more customers. On a daily level, Etsy publishes inspiring stories about its merchants or goods they are selling, and their audience loves it.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559120978876-1559120978875.png" width="602" height="377" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="influencer">15. Using influencer marketing: Koovs</h3><p dir="ltr">We already mentioned that social media tremendously changed customer behaviour over the last few years.

    html: '<p dir="ltr">Your website is one of the most vital places where you can introduce your business to a large audience. As almost every company has its own website to present its products and services, it&rsquo;s inevitable for other businesses to do the same. After all, the majority of today&rsquo;s Internet users are researching certain products and services online before making their purchase decision. So, not having a website could be a fatal error for your business!</p><p dir="ltr">But, building your own website can be pretty overwhelming. That&rsquo;s why many businesses hire professionals to do that for them. Not knowing the costs of building and maintaining a website is one of the biggest concerns for them. So, we&rsquo;ve decided to answer this question once and for all: How much does a website cost to build in Singapore?</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">Table of contents</h6><h5 dir="ltr"><a href="#decidingfactors">1.

Hiring Professionals</a></h5><hr><h3 id="factors">1. Deciding factors</h3><p dir="ltr">The final cost for web development services can vary depending on several factors. It&rsquo;s very important to be aware of all these costs because it will help you decide whether you will hire professionals to do the entire website or you will do it on your own. Here is a breakdown of costs you need to consider if you&rsquo;re building your website in Singapore.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="domain">1.1 Domain name</h4><p dir="ltr">The first step when building a website is purchasing your domain name. The registration itself is not expensive and is paid annually. As you&rsquo;re doing your research online, you will notice a lot of registrars offer various discounts if you register your domain for a few years ahead. This is an excellent option as it saves you money and ensures you don&rsquo;t lose the domain name you&rsquo;ve chosen because you forgot to pay for another year. After you&rsquo;ve checked if a certain domain name is still available, you will need to choose among various domain extensions. If your business is focused mostly on the market in Singapore, consider choosing .sg or .com.sg for your domain extensions.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559898471806-1559898471805.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">The following are typical annual costs based on the choice of your domain extensions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">.com &ndash; S$20</li><li dir="ltr">.net &nbsp;-S$20</li><li dir="ltr">.com.sg &ndash; S$60</li><li dir="ltr">.sg &ndash; S$60</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr" id="web">1.2 Web host and software</h4><p dir="ltr">After you&rsquo;ve decided on your domain name and domain extension, you should focus on web hosting and software. With numerous hosting options, you can even choose between free and paid options. Your choice will be determined by the options you need and the service level you want. Besides the hardware, you will need software as well. With Content Management Systems (CMS), it&rsquo;s easy to create a professional business website without coding. One of the most popular CMS platforms is WordPress, as most hosting providers support it, so it takes just a few clicks to install it on your chosen hosting. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of WordPress, you can choose Wix or Weebly which don&rsquo;t require purchasing a separate web hosting package because it&rsquo;s already implemented in your Wix or Weebly website. Below, you can find a comparison of costs for Wordpress and Wix or Weebly.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wordpress</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Domain name: S$5 per month (for .com.sg or .sg)</li><li dir="ltr">Hosting: S$10 per month</li><li dir="ltr">Website software: free</li><li dir="ltr">Maintenance: S$80 per month</li></ul><p><strong>Wix or Weebly</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Domain name: the first year is free</li><li dir="ltr">Hosting: not applicable</li><li dir="ltr">Website software: from S$6 to S$65 per month</li><li dir="ltr">Maintenance: S$80 per month</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr" id="wordpress">1.3 How to Create a Website in WordPress</h4><h4><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559898636188-Screenshot+2019-06-07+at+5.10.32+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h4><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re considering building the website on your own, you can easily do it with WordPress in a few simple steps. Below is the process broken down into four main steps essential for the creation of your website:</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.3.1 Get a web hosting and register your domain name</h5><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560146300464-1560146300463.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii">There are plenty of web hosting providers that are cost-effective and a great start for your business website. Some of the most popular ones are InMotion hosting, Bluehost, HostGator, Hostinger and GoDaddy. Then, add your personal information &ndash; first and last name, street address, city, zip code, country, phone number and email address. To continue with the process, you will need to add your payment information and finally, make a payment.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.3.2 Set up your website</h5><p dir="ltr">You can install WordPress with a one-click installation which makes the entire process a lot easier. Log into your account on your chosen web hosting provider&rsquo;s platform, go to control panel, find the WordPress icon, choose the domain name and click &lsquo;Install Now&rsquo;.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.3.3 Design your website&nbsp;</h5><p dir="ltr">Once you&rsquo;ve set up your website, you&rsquo;ll notice a plain, basic design. If you want to avoid having a website with WordPress templates, you will need to find adequate design template. There are plenty of free and paid templates to choose from.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.3.4 Add content to your website</h5><p dir="ltr">Your website will be useless without quality content. To add a page like &lsquo;About Us&rsquo; or &lsquo;Services&rsquo;, simply find in the dashboard option &lsquo;Pages&rsquo; and then click &lsquo;Add New&rsquo;. Here, you can add text, images and other multimedia and press &lsquo;Save&rsquo; when you want to exit. If you want to add pages to your navigation menu, click on &lsquo;Appearances&rsquo; and then choose &lsquo;Menus&rsquo;. Find the page you&rsquo;ve previously created and press &lsquo;Add to Menu&rsquo;.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="wix">1.4 How to Create a Website in Wix</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559899398452-Screenshot+2019-06-07+at+5.23.14+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">If you prefer to create a website in Wix instead of WordPress, you&rsquo;ll be thrilled to hear that the process is also very simple and, more importantly, free. To help you do it right, we bring you steps you need to follow to create your business website in Wix.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.4.1 Create an account</h5><p dir="ltr">Just as it is with every other platform, you will need to create your account and sign up before you start creating your website. All you need to do is enter your email address and choose a password or you can simply sign up with your Google or Facebook social account.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.4.2 Choose among Wix website types&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560146669371-Screenshot+2019-06-10+at+2.04.23+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h5><p dir="ltr">Start by browsing your options and you&rsquo;ll see a business website, blog, online stores, and so on. Also, you can choose the website type based on the nature of your business, so it might be photography, accommodation, restaurants, etc. Keep in mind that your selection will impact the options and templates you will be able to choose from later.&nbsp;</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.4.3 Select a template</h5><p dir="ltr">You can find the template for your website by searching for something specific or you can go through some of the most popular templates on this platform. Also, Wix has various categories so you can find templates specifically for your type of business.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.4.4 Change your details&nbsp;</h5><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560146894757-Screenshot+2019-06-10+at+2.08.10+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Update your business name and all other text elements of the page to make it specific for your business. It&rsquo;s very simple to change these details as all you have to do is to add your text wherever you need and save it.</p><h5 dir="ltr">1.4.5 Update Media<br><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560147058491-Screenshot+2019-06-10+at+2.10.53+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h5><p dir="ltr">Visual elements of the site can also be changed. If you want to include photos in your chosen template, just click on the place predicted for photos and make it more customized. Also, you can change the background of the page by clicking on the background option and choosing a color or even uploading an image or a video that will serve as the background of your website.</p><p dir="ltr">Both WordPress and Wix allow you to make this an ongoing process. Change the elements when you need to, update the website with new content and add more features to it. Take care of your website as it&rsquo;s a powerful platform that can turn numerous visitors into your loyal customers.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="design">1.5 Design and production</h4><p dir="ltr">When talking about web design and production, the cost can also vary significantly. With Microsoft Office Live Small Business, you can get free website templates or spend around S$270 to purchase a premium template for your business. Alternative vendors offer various packages starting from S$10 per month for hosting with a free domain name to S$50 for monthly website maintenance. However, if you want a professional designer to work on your web design, be aware that an average cost is around S$7,000 for a basic site and much higher for a complex one. Before investing your money in web design, be certain what your requirements are to make the project cost- and time-effective.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="functionality">1.6 Functionality</h4><p dir="ltr">When going through the prices of many web design and web development companies in Singapore, you will notice that functionality is another crucial factor. Depending on your website functionality, the final cost can vary from S$4,000 to S$30,000. Simple web design can cost you as little as S$60 per month, but you will need to build a website on your own. For basic or medium functionality, the price will vary on required features, but the average price is between S$7,000 and S$10,000. Of course, for complex sites, you will need to pay a significantly higher amount of money as they are based on custom management systems.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="others">1.7 Others</h4><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of other factors which will impact the final cost of building your website. One of them is your site content. What content will you add to your website? Who will work on that content? After all, a nicely crafted sales copy is vital if you wish to engage your target audience. If you don&rsquo;t have the time or skills to write your own content, consider hiring a professional copy or content writer. Most of them charge per hour or by the word, and their prices also vary depending on their expertise, years of experience, achievements, geographical location, etc. Don&rsquo;t forget about the video which is the most engaging type of content right now. Crafting and implementing videos into your website will be another cost you need to add to your list.</p><p dir="ltr">Other factors which will determine the cost of hiring a web design and web development company or a professional are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Need for multiple languages</li><li dir="ltr">Navigation structure</li><li dir="ltr">Responsive design</li><li dir="ltr">Frequency of updates</li><li dir="ltr">Database integration</li><li dir="ltr">Number of pages</li><li dir="ltr">E-commerce functionalities</li><li dir="ltr">Special features or animations</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">Choosing between template and custom solutions</h4><p dir="ltr">You can have impeccable content, but without quality design, it will be impossible to have a strong impact on your customers. Investing in your web design and development is a priority for every business that wants successful results. The only question here is whether you will invest in template-based solutions or create a custom built website. Both solutions will provide you with great options and benefits for your business if you implement them the right way.<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559899524973-Screenshot+2019-06-07+at+5.25.16+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">However, custom website design will be created specifically for your business and it will provide your customer with a unique experience. Having a template-based solution is great if you don&rsquo;t have enough money to get a customized one or if you think your business doesn&rsquo;t need a professionally designed website. But, if you can choose among these two solutions, always choose a custom built website.</p><h3 dir="ltr">2. Custom-built websites</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Benefits of custom built websites</h4><p dir="ltr">When you have a custom built website, you also have a unique design which is created just for your business. It will highlight all your strengths and values so your customers can understand your business better. Being able to communicate your key messages the way you want and where you want is crucial for maintaining successful communication with your target audience. If you choose a custom built website, you can have an impact on the final design. Providing a designer with your feedback will ensure you get the web design you want.</p><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559899592902-1559899592901.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr">Designers know which elements they need to cover in the web design process to ensure the best results for your business. For instance, they will work on the design and also make it search engine friendly. After all, website architecture is a crucial factor that will determine the website&rsquo;s ranking on result pages of popular search engines, such as Google, Yahoo or Bing. Neglecting the importance of it by not hiring a professional web designer might have negative consequences for your entire online presence.</p><p dir="ltr">When thinking about what your website should look like, you probably already have an idea about features you would like to add. If you hire a professional web designer, your website features will be prioritized the way you want them. Keep in mind that the website will be active for a longer period and some features might be even added later. Being aware of your future plans or even the possibility of enhancing the website at some point, a good web designer will use the technologies that make your website easy to upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">There are five main elements when talking about custom built websites that you have to be aware of. By going through each of them, it will be easier for you to understand why custom built websites are also called complex websites. Determining your budget, duration of the project, the importance of your brand to your business, the level of user experience and scalability will be the first phase of your custom web design project.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="budget">2.1 &nbsp;Budget</h4><p dir="ltr">Of course, your budget is the most important factor when talking about a custom built website. If you&rsquo;re certain you don&rsquo;t want to have a template-based website but your budget is really limited, explain it to the designer. Keep in mind that you can always add more features later. Having a customized solution is not too expensive if you think about all the benefits it will provide for your business in the long run. Think of it as investing in a very powerful platform which will engage your target audience and encourage them to purchase your products or services.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="time">2.2 &nbsp;Time</h4><p dir="ltr">Building a customized website takes time and you can&rsquo;t expect to have a quality website in a week or two. That&rsquo;s why many businesses choose a template-based website as they don&rsquo;t have time to go through the entire web design and development process. However, being a part of this process will ensure only the best solutions for your website as you will be able to review the project and make adjustments when necessary.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="brand">2.3 Your brand</h4><p dir="ltr">You have probably already built the brand of your company and website is the perfect place to showcase it. The only way to stand out from the crowd and present all your brand strengths is by hiring a professional website designer. Your brand&rsquo;s personality depends on the relationship you have with your customers. But, a template-based solution can&rsquo;t provide you with a tailor-made approach that will impress your target audience. To establish meaningful relationships with your customers, you will need to build a unique website just for them.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="ux">2.4 User experience</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560147326497-1560147326495.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">Nowadays, it&rsquo;s all about user experience. Having a bad website where your customers can&rsquo;t find what they are looking for will have negative results for your business. A custom website will provide you with the needed optimization and accessibility. Setting yourself apart from your competition is easier if your website has a fantastic level of user experience. After all, making the entire customer journey enjoyable is the key to success.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="scalability">2.5 &nbsp;Long-term scalability</h4><p dir="ltr">We&rsquo;ve already mentioned you should think about adding more features after your website has been built. As your business grows, your website will grow as well. With template-based solutions, it&rsquo;s very difficult to add elements and features after your website design and development have been finished. Not to mention that adding elements on such websites will result in slower loading times, which you simply can&rsquo;t afford to happen. Instead, if you&rsquo;re planning on increasing scalability to a wider audience, your choice should always be a custom built website.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="custom">2.6 Custom-built website costs</h4><p dir="ltr">If your website needs to be developed from scratch, the price can be anywhere from S$4,000 to S$10,000 or even more, depending on the level of customization your business needs. However, there are components which can be adjusted so the final price fits your budget and provides you with a professionally designed website.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Number of pages</strong> &ndash; the lower the number of pages on your website, the lower the final cost will be.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style of design</strong> &ndash; the website can have a simple, moderately stylized, high-end or world-class design.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Copywriting</strong> &ndash; the price will depend on the number of pages that need a copy.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>SEO</strong> &ndash; the price will depend on the number of keywords for placement on search engines.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Responsive design</strong> &ndash; websites with responsive design will be an extra cost to consider.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>E-commerce functionality</strong> &ndash; you can choose among basic, advanced or enterprise option.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Database integration</strong> &ndash; the website can have basic, advanced or full development integration.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>CMS&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; you can choose among standard, advanced or enterprise option.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="types">3. Different Types of Websites</h3><p dir="ltr">Your website will depend on the nature of your business and all the features you wish to include. This also means that the price will vary from one business to another. Of course, the simplest websites will also be the cheapest whereas adding additional elements or customizing the entire website will increase the overall price.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="basic">3.1 Basic Websites</h4><p dir="ltr">These websites are usually the ones that are created to provide information about something. Most of the time, their goal is not to convert customers or engage them into action but to offer information about a certain topic or organisation. Basic, informative websites will usually be created for law firms, hospitals, restaurants, travel organisations, etc. As they&rsquo;re solely interested in providing essential information to their target audience, they will lack other elements such as captivating, interactive design or integration with other applications.</p><p dir="ltr">A basic website has anywhere from 5 to 10 pages, such as &lsquo;Home page&rsquo;, &lsquo;About Us&rsquo;, &lsquo;Services&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Contact Us&rsquo;. Most of them also include blogs where they publish their content on industry trends and business-related topics. If your business needs a basic website, you will need to pay between S$2,000 and S$10,000. The lowest price is for websites that have up to 5 pages and a basic functionality while including the content and more complex elements will easily increase the price. &nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="community">3.2 Community Websites</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560336285903-Screenshot+2019-06-12+at+6.44.42+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">As their name says, community websites have a huge community that regularly checks the content of these sites. They are incredibly popular with their target audiences and are focused on encouraging the interaction and engagement of the audience. One of the most vital features on this type of websites is account sign-ups where users can upload their own images and interact with the business or organisation on a deeper level.</p><p dir="ltr">Community websites will cost from S$15,000 to S$50,000, depending on the features your business needs for your website. Of course, if you have your own app for business, the integration will also increase the overall price.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="ecommerce">3.3 E-commerce websites</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560335924054-Screenshot+2019-06-12+at+6.38.39+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">Building an E-commerce website is much more complicated than creating a static, basic website. These websites imply a high level of customization, functionality and fluidity. All your products have their corresponding content which usually includes text, images and sometimes videos. The more content and subpages your websites has, the more complex it will be to build it. That&rsquo;s why the cost of these websites can be very high when compared to other types of websites.</p><p dir="ltr">E-commerce websites should allow your customers to easily log in, go through dozens, hundreds or even thousands of your products, and easily go through all the phases until they can finally make a payment and order the product. Building an E-commerce website will cost you anywhere from S$10,000 to S$50,000.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="hiring">4. Hiring Professionals</h3><p dir="ltr">When building your business website, you will need to consider some other costs that are vital for the quality of your website. From hiring a designer who will work on your product photos, background images and other visual elements to a copywriter whose words will engage your audience, a good website is never actually completed. It&rsquo;s an ongoing process and you need people who will help you to maintain it.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, you can hire these professionals when you need them, but to reach the best possible results for your business, consider having them as a constant part of your team.</p><h4 dir="ltr">4.1 Web Designer</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560145738954-1560145738954.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">A web designer is a creative individual with technical skills to rebuild or design your business website.

To hire a freelance web designer on an hourly rate, you will need to pay from S$25 to S$50, depending on the designer&rsquo;s experience and your requirements.</p><h4 dir="ltr">4.2 Web Developer</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560145881772-1560145881772.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">To turn your design into a functional website, you will need a web developer. They will write endless lines of a complicated code by using programming languages, such as Python or HTML. When talking about web developers, you need to think about front-end and back-end as both are equally important for your website. To hire a freelance web developer, you will need to pay between S$40 and S$100 per hour, depending on the developer&rsquo;s experience and your requirements.</p><h4 dir="ltr">4.3 Copywriter</h4><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560145963719-1560145963719.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">To make your website truly engaging, you will need a skilful copywriter who can create magic with his or her words.

What is SEO?</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Before we dive deep, it&rsquo;s important to understand what SEO really is.</p><p dir="ltr">SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It focuses on improving the ranking and visibility of a website through organic search engine results.</p><p dir="ltr">In this context, &lsquo;organic&rsquo; refers to search results that are earned through effective SEO instead of through paid advertising.</p><p dir="ltr">This allows your website to naturally display higher in search engine results pages for free.</p><p dir="ltr">Basically, the better&nbsp;SEO, the better chances of being displayed on&nbsp;top&nbsp;search engine result pages (SERP). This means more readers if you&rsquo;re a blog website and more potential leads if you&rsquo;re selling a product or service.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="why"><strong>2. Why is SEO Important?</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">While you could pay for advertising to help improve your website rankings, it&rsquo;s not necessary. Simply optimizing your website will make a difference&nbsp;because&nbsp;of the fact that most online traffic is driven by search engines.</p><p dir="ltr">This means that your website can gain traffic without spending a single penny.</p><p dir="ltr">It may sound hard to believe but think about the last time you used a web address to visit a website. Most likely you used a search engine with a simple keyword or phrase to help pull up the website you were looking for.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="how"><strong>3. How SEO Works</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">SEO works hand in hand with search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing.</p><p dir="ltr">By using algorithms, search engines can determine a website&rsquo;s relevance to a search by analyzing its content and information. Then the results are organized based on the goal of providing the most useful information to the user.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="rank"><strong>4. What Can You Do to Rank Higher?</strong></h3><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559037890201-pexels-photo-2306359.jpeg" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>Now that we&rsquo;ve defined SEO and how it works, you&rsquo;re probably wondering how you can be more relevant and rank higher in SERPs. Well luckily, there&rsquo;s more than one way.</p><p dir="ltr">Below I&rsquo;ve separated the SEO tips to on-site and off-site, that way it&rsquo;s easier to follow and understand.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="onSite"><strong>5. On-site SEO</strong></h3><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559038866885-pexels-photo-386025.jpeg" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>On-site SEO is also known as on-page SEO. This refers to optimizing elements on a website, it&rsquo;s pages, and HTML to rank higher in search engine results (SERPS).</p><p dir="ltr">Proper on-site SEO helps your audience clearly understand what your website is about. It also helps search engines interpret content the way your audience would see it based on the content and keywords.</p><p dir="ltr">To make it simple, the goal of on-site SEO is to make it possible for search engines and users to:</p><ol><li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 20px;">understand the purpose and intent of a web page</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 20px;">identifies if the page is relevant to a keyword or phrase</span></li><li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 20px;">find it useful and worthy of ranking high on SERPs</span></li></ol><h4 dir="ltr" id="keyword"><strong>5.1 Keywords and Phrases</strong></h4><p dir="ltr">The easiest way to get started with on-site SEO is by choosing a keyword or phrase that&rsquo;s relevant to your website. Having a list of keywords is one of the most crucial steps in your search engine optimization strategy.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559038043426-pexels-photo-1430121.jpeg" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p dir="ltr">A good place to start is on Google. Start by identifying terms and topics that relate to your website. Just search a keyword and scroll down to the bottom of the page for similar results and keywords searched. You can also conduct research on Google Adwords to find the most relevant keyword.</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, there are plenty of free online tools that will help you find the keywords you need. Some of them are:</p><ol><li><a href="https://keywordtool.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keywordstool.io</a></li><li><a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Answer The Public</a></li><li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Trends</a></li><li><a href="https://keywordseverywhere.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keywords Everywhere</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wordtracker.com/scout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordtracker Scout</a></li></ol><p dir="ltr">Whichever method or tool you decide to use to compile the list of your keywords, you should make it an ongoing process. The biggest mistake most marketers will make is to do their keyword research only once. So, updating your keyword list is a must.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When targeting keywords, don&rsquo;t focus on the ones that are too popular as it means they are too competitive and you won&rsquo;t get the ranking you want.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="onSiteContent"><strong>5.2 Content</strong></h4><p dir="ltr">SEO is very helpful. But content is still king.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559038841554-nature-grass-leaf-green.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Anytime you use a search engine, you are searching for the answer to a question or useful information. You are looking for content and that&rsquo;s what helps gain greater visibility for two reasons. First, the customer is looking for content. Second, search engines use content to determine relevancy to a user&rsquo;s search query.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to content, longer typically ranks better. Longer&nbsp;content is seen as being more thorough and helpful, typically. But longer content can get messy and that can work against you.</p><p dir="ltr">Maintain clean-formatting and sentences that are direct and purposeful to maximize your user experience.</p><p dir="ltr">It helps to start with keyword research, but starting with content is possible too.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">With optimized content, you have higher chances of attracting more audience to your website.</p><p dir="ltr">There are four things you need to do if you wish to fully optimize your content. The first is already covered with discovering your keywords. Of course, writing about topics people are currently interested in will increase your traffic numbers.</p><p dir="ltr">The second thing you need to do is to work on keyword optimization. Knowing when and how to use your keywords is essential for having a successfully optimized website.</p><p dir="ltr">Thirdly, your website content should be organized in a logical order for search engines to crawl it and your visitors to find what they need easily.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there is the content promotion. Your content needs to be promoted if you wish it to achieve the business results you want. Use your social media platforms and email marketing to reach great results.</p><p dir="ltr">There are many types of content you can create and optimize to attract more traffic to your website. Some of the most popular ones are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Blog articles</li><li dir="ltr">Lists</li><li dir="ltr">Guides</li><li dir="ltr">Videos</li><li dir="ltr">Infographics</li><li dir="ltr">Slideshows</li><li dir="ltr">Directories</li><li dir="ltr">Glossaries</li></ul><p dir="ltr">After you&rsquo;ve crafted some of your finest pieces of content, you will notice you need to have it organized. Having an editorial calendar will keep you on track.</p><p dir="ltr">You can use Outlook or Google Calendar and share it with your team. In your calendar, you should have ongoing items such as a new article every Wednesday or a new guide every month.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure you have enough time to create quality content. It&rsquo;s better to publish quality content once a week than have three articles per week that nobody will want to read.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="url"><strong>5.3 URL Structure</strong></h4><p dir="ltr">When it comes to URL structure it&rsquo;s best to keep it simple. It should be easy to remember and easy to type. Make sure your URL is short and includes the keyword or phrase you&rsquo;ve chosen to optimize with.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The URL structure will provide you with great benefits, such as improved user experience, better rankings on search engines and more traffic. Well-written URL lets people know what your content is about, so if it&rsquo;s intriguing enough, they will click on it.</p><p dir="ltr">If somebody sees only your URL, would they know what the content is about? Also, if you use more words, use hyphens to separate them. Never use uppercase letters when creating URLs as it might cause an issue with duplicate pages.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="meta"><strong>5.4 Meta Descriptions</strong></h4><p dir="ltr">Meta-descriptions summarize the purpose and intent of a page. This is the description that shows up on search results that quickly addresses the search. It should include your keywords and any relevant information.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">It shouldn&rsquo;t be longer than 155 words if you want to have well-optimized meta descriptions. A good meta description will increase your click-through rate from search engines.</p><p dir="ltr">Write your meta descriptions in active voice and make them actionable. A good piece of advice would be to include a call-to-action message in it as it will encourage more people to click on it. Add to your next meta description common call-to-action phrases such as &lsquo;Find out&rsquo;, &lsquo;Learn more&rsquo;, &lsquo;Try it for free&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get it now&rsquo;.</p><p dir="ltr">However, you should never create a misleading meta description as Google will penalize it eventually. Your meta description should always match your content.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="image"><strong>5.5 Image Optimization</strong></h4><p><strong><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559038812110-pexels-photo-1779487.jpeg" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong>When an image is placed on a website or in a blog post, a search engine doesn&rsquo;t see it. What it does identify are file names and relevant keywords. By re-titling your images, you can help search engines keep you relevant.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Start by reducing your image size to ensure your website performance better. Bigger image sizes will cause a loading problem and slow down your entire website.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure you choose the right format for your images. Some of the most popular are JPEG PNG and GIF. Experimenting with other formats might harm your website optimization and, consequently, your ranking.</p><p dir="ltr">When compressing, don&rsquo;t hurt the image quality. The goal is to have smaller-sized images, not low-quality content on your website.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what should you keep in mind when it comes to on-site optimization? Here is the list of on-site optimization elements:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keyword research</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Title tags, header tags, image alt tags and meta descriptions</li><li dir="ltr">URL structure</li><li dir="ltr">Internal linking structure</li><li dir="ltr">Quality and diverse content</li><li dir="ltr">Responsive website design</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="offSite"><strong>6. Off-Site SEO</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Off-site SEO is also called off-page SEO, and it refers to optimizing your website to improve your relevancy, importance, and authority in SERPs through links and other related external online content.</p><p dir="ltr">This shows search engines that your website provides useful information and serves as a valuable resource for users.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">As search algorithms and ranking factors never stop changing, your off-site SEO strategy is vital for your website success.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="link"><strong>6.1 Link Building</strong></h4><p dir="ltr">Links help determine popularity. The more useful and quality links, the more authority you build for yourself in front of search engines.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559038851993-pexels-photo-398550.jpeg" class="fr-fic fr-dib">Link building is a strategy used in SEO to promote your website by creating links that references similar content to other online sites. This helps search engines rank your website higher and essentially serves as a &ldquo;voucher&rdquo; for your website content.</p><p dir="ltr">It tells search engines, &ldquo;Hey, my content is relevant in all these places on the internet. Show me first.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">But be wary with links you include, as overstuffing can work against you. Only provide links if it adds value to your content and to the user experience.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When talking about link building, you should know there are three main types of links relevant to your website &ndash; natural, manually built and self-created.</p><p dir="ltr">A natural link is given by the editorial without any involvement of the page owner. A manually built link is acquired via deliberate link-building activities such as having your customers link to your website or influencers sharing your content. A self-created link is created with adding backlinks in an online directory, press release, blog comment signature, forum, etc.</p><p dir="ltr">Off-site SEO techniques are usually divided into two categories &ndash; white and black hats. White hat techniques are preferred by search engines and will help you achieve better ranking results. On the other hand, black hat techniques are deceptive and will lead to penalties or being banned by search engines.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="white"><strong>6.2 White Hat Techniques</strong></h4><p dir="ltr">If you haven&rsquo;t heard of the phrase &lsquo;White hat techniques&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of some of it commonly used techniques such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Competition analysis to better understand strategies that help you achieve great ranking on search engines</li><li dir="ltr">Research the keywords you want to rank for</li><li dir="ltr">Determine who is ranking highly with these keywords</li><li dir="ltr">Find a way how to provide your audience with a better, optimized web design</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These tactics will add value to your website&rsquo;s SEO, ensure a fantastic website design experience and, of course, increase your ranking and traffic. When utilizing these tactics, always treat them as an ongoing process instead of a one-off thing. If implemented right, they can bring enormous benefits to your business.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="black">6.3 Black Hat Techniques</h4><p dir="ltr">Unlike white hat techniques, these ones will result in devastating consequences for your website and your business as well. These techniques were very popular in the past as it allowed marketers to achieve high rankings incredibly quickly. To fight this, search engines updated their algorithms to detect it. Nowadays, if you use any of the black hat techniques, search engines will penalize you or even ban you from their results. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s really hard to recover your status once you&rsquo;ve been banned by Google.</p><p dir="ltr">Below you can find some of the most popular black hat techniques:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Buying links</li><li dir="ltr">Link farming</li><li dir="ltr">Selling links</li><li dir="ltr">Keyword spamming and stuffing</li><li dir="ltr">Hidden content and links</li><li dir="ltr">Cloaking</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These tactics were mostly used in the past when search engines weren&rsquo;t so efficient in detecting them, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there are still no black hat techniques utilized by many marketers. Some of today&rsquo;s black hat techniques that are popular with marketers who, despite the consequences, want instant results are thin and duplicate content, cloaking and keyword stuffing.</p><p dir="ltr">Thin content is when you create several individual pages that have almost the exact content. Creating multiple pages of content to target different audiences shouldn&rsquo;t result in almost identical pages. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called thin content because it&rsquo;s similarity led to multiple pages with almost exact content.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">This low-quality content is monitored by Google very closely since 2011 after they&rsquo;ve created their update known as Panda. Instead of having several pages with the same topic and different keywords, you should create one comprehensive page which will contain all vital information</p><p dir="ltr">Duplicate content is the same content shared between more domains or pages within a single domain. Not having original content that brings value to the audience is something search engines will never encourage.</p><p dir="ltr">However, there are reasons for having the same content on different platforms, but that should be done with a rel=canonical tag that point to the original version of the content. On the contrary, you&rsquo;re risking that Google chooses to show the original in the search results and not your version.</p><p dir="ltr">Cloaking is mentioned above in our list of black hat techniques. It refers to showing the same content to engine crawlers as it would be shown to one of your visitors. This implies you shouldn&rsquo;t hide text in the HTML code of your website. If you do that, search engines will prevent it from showing in the search results.</p><p dir="ltr">Keyword stuffing happens when businesses don&rsquo;t understand SEO, so they will add a certain keyword numerous times thinking it will result in better ranking on search engine result page. Actually, the quality of the entire content on your page is much more important the number of times you&rsquo;ve used a specific keyword. All of your keywords should be incorporated in the article naturally.</p><hr><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve done it. You&rsquo;ve made your way to the end of the guide but you might feel like there&rsquo;s still so much to know.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily there are other respectable resources that provide in-depth information on SEO.</p><p dir="ltr">Some include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><br></p>',

    html:
      '<p>Keeping your website looking fresh and attractive is a vital part of engaging with key audiences and building a solid marketing and sales outreach strategy. Website redesign should ideally take place at least every five years or less. Here&rsquo;s a detailed look at some large scale website redesigns that have been widely successful and resulted in higher conversation rates.</p>\n' +
      "<h3>1. Reddit's major redesign</h3>\n" +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre1.png" alt="reddit search result"></p>' +
      '<h3>After website redesign</h3>' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre2.png" alt="updated reddit search result"></p>' +
      '<p>The new Reddit highlights easy navigation with a hamburger menu on the left side of the screen, that presents your feed, profiles and any subscriptions you have. There are also a selection of buttons that Redditors can use to change the format of the website according to their individual preference. Card view is a flatter appearance like Facebook, while the compact view lets you view myriad content with an effortless scroll.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>2. Updating the Dropbox Brand</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre3.png" alt="old dropbox ui"></p>\n' +
      '<h3>After website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre4.png" alt="updated dropbox ui"></p>\n' +
      '<p>The older version of Dropbox was very content-heavy, with minimum white spacing between each row and small icons that were often difficult to understand. There was no clear distinction between options such as New Folder, Bin and Upload. Now, information is clearly displayed, with additional features such as a thumbnail view to get a glimpse at each file and check who the collaborators are on a file. For better privacy and security, there is more obvious account separation as well.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>3. Minimalist visuals with Instagram</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre5.png" alt="old instagram ui"></p>\n' +
      '<h3>After website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre6.png" alt="updated instagram ui"></p>\n' +
      '<p>Instagram got a website overhaul back in 2018, but most of the popular features remain unchanged. You can still scroll through your feed and double-tap to like photos, comment on images and browse through other people&rsquo;s profiles. But the square-shaped profile photos are now rounded, while the grid of images placed above the user name is no longer there.</p>\n' +
      '<p>The Instagram blue is replaced by a combination gray, white and black theme that is attractive and modern. Overall, the interface is simplified with a flatter design versus the older preference for skeuomorphism. The Instagram app suite was not very consistent in terms of its look and feel. The redesign process helped to integrate all aspects of the app for a cohesive appearance.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>4. Simpler layout for Twitter</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre7.1.png" alt="old twitter ui"></p>\n' +

      '<p>Compared to the old layout, Twitter now offers two columns for content instead of three. The feed is located on the left side of the screen, with trending topics and user suggestions placed on the right. There are added options to include emojis in tweets, bookmark and explore. Trends section is more functional and shows marked improvements with updates. When you compose a tweet, the pop-up has a distinctive appearance which is an open space instead of a rectangular box. The &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; icon is now moved to the top of the page.</p>' +
      "<h3>5.Mailchimp's new look</h3>\n" +
      '<h3>Before website design</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre8.png" alt="old mailchimp ui"></p>\n' +

      '<p>While Mailchimp&rsquo;s website was functioning perfectly well earlier, the company wanted to make a statement and highlight a clear value proposition to its growing customer base. The older version of the homepage was clean and easy to navigate, with a top menu and an organized landing page decorated by a hero image. The redesigning has resulted in quirky imagery and a brighter colour palette, which strays away from typical typeface and wordmark.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>6. Powerful engagement at the Art Institute of Chicago</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website design</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre10.png" alt="old chicago website"></p>\n' +

      '<p>The new website for the Art Institute of Chicago is much improved in UX terms. Firstly, it&rsquo;s fully responsive and can now be read comfortably on any device. The top navigation has been simplified to include a handful of clear links without clunky drop-down menus. There&rsquo;s also a space for temporary announcements.</p>\n' +
      '<p>The carousel has been dropped in exchange for a single hero video, adding movement and life to this primary graphical element. Exhibition info is now presented over an opaque gray layer, vastly improving readability.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>7. UserTesting: enhances the customer experience</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre12.png" alt="old usertesting ui"></p>\n' +

      '<p>The new UserTesting homepage is crafted beautifully, with a light and easy to understand page with the word count reduced by 25%. The carousel that was present in the old version of the landing page now showcases good quality images that are consistent with the brand.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>8. Panos Pictures&rsquo; website revamp</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre14.png" alt="old panos pictures ui"></p>\n' +

      '<p>The Panos Pictures website provides great elements that adapt to a user&rsquo;s display. There is no longer a navigation menu on the top, as it is hidden behind a hamburger menu icon htat expands when selected. The brand logo and search fields did not undergo any change.</p>' +
      '<h3>9. <a href="http://Rev.com">Rev.com</a></h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre16.png" alt="old rev.com ui"></p>\n' +

      '<p>The previous version of Rev was looking like it needed some upgrades to bring it to a 21st century audience. The main features was the carousel in the center the three values of the company shared &ndash; quality, speed and service. With the website revamp, one can find a menu bar above the carousel, that connects you to the company&rsquo;s main services, and these services were linked to retro graphics, and some the different pricing levels of plans on offer.</p>\n' +
      '<h3>10. How <a href="http://slack.com">slack.com</a> shaped its image</h3>\n' +
      '<h3>Before website redesign</h3>\n' +
      '<p><img src="/post/image/94fda884-6d5c-45b1-97a3-b0e8a2e36d95/wre18.png" alt="old slack.com ui"></p>\n' +

      '<p>In the older version of the landing page, <a href="http://slack.com">slack.com</a> had a flatter appearance that belonged to an earlier decade. Instead, now, there is an easily accessible menu on the top section with details such as pricing, location and &lsquo;find your workspace&rsquo;. In case the intention is to be more proactive, you can find out if things are okay. Now slack allows business owners to directly communicate with customers regarding comments and queries with a few configurations.</p>\n' +
      '<p>With this impressive array of the latest UX designs being used for websites, most of them have a carousel to give an immediate glimpse into unique products or services. One of a kind imagery, tailored content for better engagement and other multimedia alternatives can significantly boost the number of visitors to the landing page. With a tendency towards less text and more visuals, many of the websites reviewed show that the carousel is no longer a primary element needed to develop a top notch website.</p>',

    html: '<p dir="ltr">Revamping your website can help you with achieving your online business goals in no time. Unfortunately, many companies find it overwhelming to figure out what changes are best in their context to see positive results with conversion rates. Here are a few tips that should be kept in mind when undertaking research to implement conversion rate optimization:</p><hr><h6 dir="ltr">table of contents</h6><h5>1. <a href="#foundation">Your website needs a solid foundation</a></h5><ol><li><a href="#attractiveDesign">Attractive Design</a></li><li><a href="#functionsSeamlessly">Ensure your website functions seamlessly</a></li><li><a href="#easyNagivation">Easy navigation and layout</a></li><li><a href="#wordsNGraphics">Make your words and graphics count</a></li></ol><h5>2. <a href="#checkoutProcess">Constant improve the length of checkout process</a></h5><ol><li><a href="#checkoutFlow">Understand the checkout flow</a></li><li><a href="#reviewCheckout">Set a schedule to review the checkout process</a></li></ol><h5>3. <a href="#customerValue">Build lifetime customer value</a></h5><ol><li><a href="#mobileReady">Mobile ready</a></li><li><a href="#onpageSeo">On page SEO</a></li></ol><h5>4. <a href="#emailLists">Build your email lists carefully</a></h5><hr><h3 dir="ltr" id="foundation">1. Your website needs a solid foundation</h3><p dir="ltr">Every website requires a strong foundation to promote customer engagement and increase profitability. No one will be persuaded to purchase your product or sign-up for a service if your website is uninspiring or fails to highlight the merits of what your company offers. A few aspects need to be developed if you want the website to be attention-grabbing:</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="attractiveDesign">1.1 Attractive design<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560400039018-Screenshot+2019-06-13+at+12.27.13+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h4><p dir="ltr">A well-designed website stands out from the rest in this highly competitive market space. Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of loading your webpages with a range of different elements that are likely to confuse the customer. Instead, focus on showcasing easy-to-navigate and visually appealing features that will hook any visitor and highlight the essence of your product or service. Sometimes, it may be better to spend extra and invest in a professionally designed website or at least modelling it based on such design layouts. Making a good impression with prospective customers is a must! Keep in mind that an average person&rsquo;s attention span is approximately 8 seconds.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="functionsSeamlessly">1.2 Ensure your website functions seamlessly</h4><p dir="ltr">Websites need to be maintained in order to function seamlessly, like a well-oiled machine. In order to avoid unexpected crashes or snags, tracking the performance of your website with data-driven analytics reports can help to keep the traffic consistent and raise the number of visitors over time.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="easyNavigation">1.3 Easy navigation and layout<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560400132213-Screenshot+2019-06-13+at+12.28.48+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h4><p dir="ltr">Complicated navigation menus and unclear page organisation can be hurting the engagement rate and conversion rate on your website. It is extremely vital to optimise navigation based on audience preference, and prioritising a clear path to knowing more about your product or service, as well as the checkout section. The key is to reduce the effort required by your customers to get what they need; this will assure them of a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="wordsNGraphics">1.4 Make your words and graphics count&nbsp;<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560400235663-Screenshot+2019-06-13+at+12.30.30+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-shadow"></h4><p dir="ltr">The type of content on your website can heavily influence how your conversation rates increase with time. Do not go with stale stock photos and boring text when creating a landing page &ndash; this will negatively affect the interest customers have. Instead, you want to give an engaging high quality image or video of what your product can offer. Visuals that are clean and make a good impression, will enhance the conversation rate significantly. In addition, focus on the type of words and language used on each page &ndash; there needs to be a sense of urgency and it should entice people to take the plunge. Remember, the call to action is not always a button that is placed on a page; it can be reinforced with tactful word usage.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="checkoutProcess">2. Constantly improve the length of the checkout process</h3><p dir="ltr">If the checkout process is time consuming and unclear, many customers abandon their purchases mid-way and close the website on their browser. Customers value the efficiency and seamlessness of a shopping experience every time. When the checkout is slow or requires too many forms being filled, conversation rates are impacted in the long run.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="checkoutFlow">2.1 Understand the checkout flow</h4><p dir="ltr">When a website visitor has decided what they want and added it to the shopping cart, they should be able to instantly access the checkout page before losing interest. Ensure that the checkout button is clearly visible no matter which page they are on, and provide lots of payment options for flexibility. Ideally, there should be checkout icons on the top and bottom of every webpage.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="reviewCheckout">2.2 Set a schedule to review the checkout process<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560400560057-Screenshot+2019-06-13+at+12.35.55+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h4><p dir="ltr">A great way to affirm the performance of your checkout process is by running A/B tests from time to time. This will also help you to better understand what aspects are driving high conversions, and capitalize on the same. Start by choosing a specific element on the webpage to test, which will result in 50% of site traffic viewing one version while the other group sees the second version. You can then run a comparative analysis between the two versions to assess which one performed better with visitors.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="customerValue">3. Build lifetime customer value</h3><p dir="ltr">There&rsquo;s an old saying that &ldquo;the customer is king&rdquo;. Your brand value is determined by happy clients, who in turn will spread the word about their positive experience. Develop a reputation as a reliable and trusted company to ultimately reap the benefits of lifetime customer value.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="mobileReady">3.1 Mobile ready&nbsp;</h4><p dir="ltr">Websites are increasingly offering mobile platforms for added convenience among site visitors. If you have additional resources, you can even offer an app based version to customers who are frequent shoppers. According to Mobile eCommerce Stats in 2018, around 62% people who possess a smartphone have made a purchase online in the past 6 months. The share of mobile retail sales is projected to rise significantly in the ecommerce market over the next few years on a global scale.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="onpageSeo">3.2 On page SEO</h4><p dir="ltr">Developing and implementing an integrated SEO strategy is essential to success, especially if you want your website to appear in various search engines. One part of this process is on-page SEO techniques (i.e. engaging description, attractive visuals, keyword usage and other content), which lets search engines know that the page is extremely relevant and good enough to be featured.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="emailLists">4. Build your email lists carefully<img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1560400607181-Screenshot+2019-06-13+at+12.36.43+PM.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></h3><p dir="ltr">Thorough and well-rounded email lists play a major role as a smart business asset, apart from the website itself. It allows you to share the latest updates directly with customers who have expressed interest in your product or service. The easy accessibility of an email inbox cannot be discounted as a fail proof sales channel. While you may have other successful ways of networking or engagement, a solid email list can make quite a difference.&nbsp;</p>',

Festival d&#39;Aix-en-Provence: The Power of Simple Lines</h3><p dir="ltr">When organizing a festival, it&rsquo;s vital that your website is created in a way that your target audience can easily find what they need. That&rsquo;s why many festival organizers will not even try to create something engaging but will stay focused on the functionality aspect. Festival d&#39;Aix-en-Provence did something completely different. For this famous festival, they&rsquo;ve created a little artwork on their website. These pink and green lines move as you enter the website and follow you as you search for more information.

These websites don&rsquo;t provide you with anything that is worth your time. So, if you visit the website of Platov International Airport, you will be more than surprised by what you see. They&rsquo;ve created a clever animation with a plane that flies and lands on the part of their logo which represents a helipad. Below it, they&rsquo;ve provided essential information for travellers simplifying the navigation through the entire website. Very simple and very clever!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559536762896-1559536762896.png" width="602" height="289" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http://rov.aero/en/">http://rov.aero/en/</a>&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="cheval">4.

This industry is more focused on creating basic, sometimes boring websites that only provide short information about their lawyers and contact information. However, Laszcuk &amp; Assoc decided to create an edgy website. And it&rsquo;s really edgy in so many ways, from having a design that wouldn&rsquo;t immediately be associated with a law firm to including edges to demonstrate how good they are with cutting-edge solutions. Completely unusual and captivating!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559536763923-1559536763923.png" width="602" height="429" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://laszczuk.pl/">https://laszczuk.pl/</a>&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="bewareOfBots">11.

Besides turning their entire website in bot language, colours and all other bot-related elements, the entire messaging is coming from the bot itself. Visiting their website is like a conversation with a kind, helpful robot who will explain to you what he will do to help you and why you should trust him. With such a unique and fresh approach, this website deserves to be seen outside its industry for inspiration.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1559536764880-1559536764880.png" width="602" height="431" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://beware-of-bots.com/">https://beware-of-bots.com/</a>&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="whiteSquare">12.

More importantly, with &lsquo;art&rsquo; and &lsquo;life&rsquo; being the only two words hand-written, they demonstrate these words actually mean the same. This hand-writing method also wants to suggest that these voids are fulfilled by their audience. All of this was created on a plain blue background and two lines of text.

Combining Form and Functionality on Your Website</h3><p dir="ltr">All designers struggle when trying to create a beautiful design while not harming the website functionality, and the reason for that is pretty simple: both form and functionality matter. Your website should engage the visitors and to do so, you will need to combine form and functionality on your website.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s where the majority of mistakes related to website design usually happen. As it&rsquo;s hard to juggle with both of these terms, it can be really challenging to find the balance that will bring you the best results.</p><p dir="ltr">You need a design to make your website attractive. Don&rsquo;t expect that your website visitors will spend a lot of their time on a website that is not visually appealing. More importantly, they will not return to your website ever again. So, neglecting the power of design could lead to traffic drop and that could have devastating consequences for your business.</p><p dir="ltr">But, design without functionality is like a lonely ship in a harbour. If you wish to see the world and witnness the actual power of that ship, you will need to focus on its functionality. When talking about website design, you will need to have clever navigation and simple-to-follow internal links and call-to-action messages.</p><p dir="ltr">When designing or re-designed a website, make sure you&rsquo;re truly bringing the best from both of these concepts. A skilful designer should know how to bring the maximum of form and functionality throughout the entire website.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561008287005-1561008287005.png" width="602" height="201" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="designing">2. Designing for Both Humans and Crawlers</h3><p dir="ltr">Websites that are considered the most popular and successful in their industries are usually the ones that are created for human visitors and search engine crawlers. The same way your visitors are able to search your content in order to find the information they need, search engine crawlers will need to search your website as well to determine how relevant your content is. In other words, make sure your website is entirely functional on the front and back end.</p><p dir="ltr">For your visitors, ensure your website has a natural flow and it&rsquo;s full of different types of content. Your images should be of high-quality and they should resonate with the visitors. Use colors that represent your brand and make sure the font is easy to read on both desktop and mobile.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t be afraid to use videos as it&rsquo;s the most engaging type of content that will also help you with your search engine rankings. When creating text for your website, all your messages should be written in a unique, straight-forward voice.</p><p dir="ltr">As many visitors will not read carefully all the information you&rsquo;ve placed on your website, make sure you strategically add headline, call-to-action-messages, bullets and other ways to capture their attention while they are scrolling down the page. A great website will have all these elements displayed without harming the vital information of the business.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561008287081-1561008287081.png" width="602" height="393" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="dynamicMobile">3. Having a Dynamic Mobile Website</h3><p dir="ltr">The number of smartphones is constantly growing across the world and its usage is expanding to areas we couldn&rsquo;t even imagined just a few years ago. Now, we&rsquo;re able to shop products ans also to research different options before making our purchase decision.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When researching, people will first visit the websites of brands they are interested in. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital to ensure you have a dynamic mobile website that will provide your mobile visitors with the same-quality experience as desktop visitors.</p><p dir="ltr">The mobile site of your website needs to be dynamic, engaging and, most importantly, it needs to load really quickly. Not having a fast mobile-friendly website will cost you a lot in traffic numbers.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, you will need to think about the navigation here as well. A great website design implies you have a navigation that allows your mobile visitors to go from one place to another with just a press of a finger or a swipe.</p><p dir="ltr">Having a dynamic mobile website also helps you with search engines as crawlers are actively looking for mobile-responsive websites. So, not only will the mobile website help you attract more mobile visitors, but you will also improve your SEO ranking.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="providing">4. Providing Useful Information to Your Visitors</h3><p dir="ltr">A great website will always aim to educate and inform its target audience, not just tell. By providing useful information on your website, you will be able to create meaningful relationships with your customers and prospects. When your website lacks valuable information, your audience gets a one-sided experience. If your visitors are unable to connect with your business, they will most likely decide not to purchase from you.</p><p dir="ltr">A great website will use design to highlight the importance of learning. You need to treat your visitors as smart learners who want to learn more about your website topic. If you design that type of website and provide them with useful information, they will certainly come back.</p><p dir="ltr">The design allows you to present yourself as the leader of the industry while slowly improving your search engine ranking with a well optimized and designed website. To become a resource in the field, you will need to have a professionally designed website. The better your website design is, the easier it will be to attract more people and interest them in your content.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561008286875-1561008286875.png" width="574" height="413" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="essentialElements">5. Five Essential Design Elements of a Good Website</h3><p dir="ltr">While you&rsquo;re ensuring your website is truly valuable to your target audience, you will need to think about a few other details that will have a tremendous impact on how well your website performs. There are hundreds of design elements that you need to keep in mind while you&rsquo;re working on the design of your website, however, they&rsquo;re not all equally important. Some of them will be deciding factors between an average and a fantastic website.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">All these elements should work towards providing a better user experience. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital to always think about combining form and functionality as without these two, user experience will not be as good as you need it to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Below, we bring you five key elements of great web design examples. Make sure you implement them right away as they will provide you with countless benefits, from improving your traffic numbers to strengthening your online reputation.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="whiteSpace">5.1 Using a lot of White Space on Your Website</h4><p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve probably already noticed that the majority of websites you see every day have a lot of white space and that is not a coincidence. White space is a term that describes the empty space of the website where there are no elements such as copy, imagines, sidebars, etc. All of these elements you have on your website needs room to breathe and to be effective. Designing a crowded website will result in disoriented visitors who will leave your website because they feel overwhelmed.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="colorPalette">5.2 Be Careful When Choosing Your Color Palette</h4><p dir="ltr">Color schemes and the way you use colors on your website is crucial for your web design. A good color palette will help you achieve cohesiveness between all this information you decide to publish on your website. Determine your primary and secondary colors to have more room for creativity when creating other pages you will need for your business as well. However, don&rsquo;t add too many colors as it might distract the visitors. Choose wisely!</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="callToAction">5.3 Add Plenty of Call-to-Action Messages on Your Website</h4><p dir="ltr">The goal of your website is not only to exist but to convert visitors into leads and customers. To do so, you will need to implement call-to-action messages throughout your website. After all, it&rsquo;s the place where you connect with the people who are interested in your business, products and content. As soon as they land on your website, they should know how to get what they want, whether that&rsquo;s subscribing to a newsletter, downloading a guide or ordering your product.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561008286932-1561008286932.png" width="602" height="212" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h4 dir="ltr" id="userfirst">5.4 Always Keep In Mind The User-First Design</h4><p dir="ltr">As many of today&rsquo;s businesses are focused just on improving their SEO ranking, they tend to forget that their website needs to be created for their users.

Start with Security</h3><p dir="ltr">The first thing you need to check when launching a website, whether it&rsquo;s in WordPress, Wix or any other platform, is to focus on security. An unsecured website will not have a good ranking on search engines so you will suffer from low traffic as people tend to avoid the ones that are not secure for them. Luckily, you can find a wide variety of tools that will help you understand how secure your website is and what needs to be improved in certain areas. Not protecting your website from possible threats can cause a lot of problems in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561365934957-1561365934957.png" width="602" height="401" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="spamwebsite">2. Protect Website from Spam</h3><p dir="ltr">When thinking of the negative things that could ruin your great website, one of the first things that will come to your mind is probably spam. Take some time to deal with spam before your launch your website. You can do so by installing a plugin that will help you handle those annoying, useless comments. There are also numerous great anti-spam plugins on the market and some of them are completely free. Make sure you get one before your website launch.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="analyticsCode">3. Create a Google Analytics Code</h3><p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve spent so much time building and designing your website and now you don&rsquo;t have a clue who is visiting it? Thankfully, you won&rsquo;t have to guess because just by adding a Google Analytics Code, you can see who is looking at your website and so much more. Start by creating a Google Analytics account and add the code to ensure you&rsquo;re tracking the entire website. Besides seeing how many people visited your website, you will see where they are coming from, how long are they staying on your website, what browser they use to access your websites, etc.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="seoplugin">4. Configure an SEO Plugin</h3><p dir="ltr">You can design the most beautiful website in the world with all the breathtaking elements, but when you look into your traffic numbers, you will be very disappointed to see these numbers are actually really low. Why is that so? Having a beautiful website design will not guarantee you traffic. For that, you will need to optimize it for search engines. If you don&rsquo;t quite understand SEO, you can start by creating your website in WordPress as it&rsquo;s search engine friendly.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561365933774-1561365933774.png" width="602" height="319" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="permalinks">5. Check Permalinks</h3><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;ve decided to create your website in WordPress, you&rsquo;ll be happy to hear that creating URLs to your pages is actually very easy. You can choose any of the previously defined structures or even create something completely unique. Everything needs to be set up right before you decide to launch your website. The process of setting up permalinks is so simple it takes only a few seconds.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="sslCertificate">6. Ensure an SSL Certificate for the Website</h3><p dir="ltr">Secure Socket Layer certificates, also known as simply SSL, are becoming increasingly crucial for business websites. If you&rsquo;re not using an SSL certificate, browsers will flag your website as insecure. As we&rsquo;ve already mentioned what are the consequences of having an unsecure website, you understand this is something you shouldn&rsquo;t allow. More importantly, it&rsquo;s really easy to fix it and the majority of hosts provide a free SSL certificate nowadays.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="indexing">7. Allow Search Engine Indexing</h3><p dir="ltr">While building a website, many of us will turn off search engine indexing. That&rsquo;s a great method while your website is still in the development mode, however, once you&rsquo;re done, you will want it to be indexed by Google and other search engines. To do that successfully, you will need to turn on the search engine indexing before launching your website.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="submitwebsite">8. Submit Your Website to Google</h3><p dir="ltr">You&rsquo;ve built and designed your website exactly how you wanted and you&rsquo;re ready for the world to see it? Then, you will need to inform the largest search engine in the world you&rsquo;re ready for some traffic. If you wish to ensure Google stops by as soon as possible, you should consider adding your website to Google and informing them they can take a look at it. Some assume this is a very complex process but it&rsquo;s unbelievably easy to do it. Just search &lsquo;Submit URL to Google&rsquo; to get an input box. Add your complete website URL, click on the button &lsquo;Submit&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re done!</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561365933537-1561365933537.png" width="602" height="452" class="fr-fic fr-dii">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="compatibility">9. Review Cross-browser Compatibility</h3><p dir="ltr">Your website visitors will come from many different places and they will use different browsers to access your website. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital to ensure your website looks and performs great with other browsers. It might be exhaustive for you to test so many browsers, but if you wish to ensure the best quality for your website visitors regardless of the browser they use, you will need to do it. To save your time, you can use tools that will help you review the cross-browser compatibility.</p><h3 dir="ltr">10. Test Website on Different Devices</h3><p dir="ltr">After you&rsquo;ve ensured that your website performs great across various browsers, it&rsquo;s time to test it on different devices as well. Luckily, you can use tools even for this to be more precise and save your time. Some of them even generate and show you screenshots of how your website looks on different devices which helps you to understand which parts of your website need to be improved to ensure all your visitors are enjoying the same website quality.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="brokenlinks">11. Check Broken Links</h3><p dir="ltr">While you&rsquo;re building your website, in all these processes of changing links and pages, it&rsquo;s possible there will be a few broken links. Before you launch your website, you should check if there are any broken links and if there are, fix them as soon as possible. Moreover, you should scan your website very often to ensure that all of your old links are working perfectly as sometimes these links can get broken and without checking it, you risk of having broken links on your website.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="optimizeimages">12. Optimize Images on Your Website</h3><p dir="ltr">By adding images, you&rsquo;re making sure your website is dynamic and captivating for your visitors. However, not optimized these images will lead to negative SEO consequences for your website, such as lowering the speed of your page loading. The smaller and more compressed your images are, the better the performance your website will have on search engines.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561365933097-1561365933097.png" width="602" height="327" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="doublecheck">13. Double-check your Grammar and Spelling</h3><p dir="ltr">Your content is the most valuable thing you can offer to your website visitors. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s vital that you double-check the grammar and spelling on your entire website, not just your blog. Take the time the read the text on all of your pages, including landing pages and SEO elements, such as meta descriptions and titles. Having a website full of grammatical errors will make it harder for you to sell whatever you&rsquo;re selling as your target audience will not be encouraged to purchase from someone who is not focused on providing the best quality content for their audience.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="adminEmail">14. Edit the Admin Email Address</h3><p dir="ltr">If you remember the first time you&rsquo;ve installed WordPress or any other CMS platform, you were asked to add your admin email address. That&rsquo;s the email address where you will be receiving notifications when something happens on your website. Once your website is ready to launch, you should check that email address once again to ensure if it&rsquo;s the right one. If you forget to check it and leave an email address that is not valid or used, you risk to miss out on things that will happen on your website.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="websiteForms">15. Test All Website Forms</h3><p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re adding forms to your website, will they provide your visitors with what they need? For instance, having a form that requires your visitors to add information for no reason can cause frustration among people. Test every form you add on your website, from their design to feedback they provide to a person who completes it. Check where these answers are being sent to and, most importantly, have a purpose for each form you add.</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.onextech.com/froala-uploads%2F1561365933227-1561365933227.png" width="602" height="383" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><hr><h3 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h3><p dir="ltr">Launching a website is not a complicated process but it involves numerous details you could easily forget. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s crucial that you have a checklist for your website launch.

      '<h2>Driving User Experience Through Data Engineering</h2>\n' +
      '<p>In today&#39;s digital age, financial institutions must deliver a seamless user experience (UX).
